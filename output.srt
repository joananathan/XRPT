1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,520
Okay.

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,760
So it's a little bit more visual.

3
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,960
So it's a little bit more visual.

4
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,940
The rule is, if they spot you with the

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,920
tag, you can't go for
them in that episode anymore.

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,280
Like, they're, you know, they're safe.

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:10,880
They've caught you.

8
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,520
You can't keep.

9
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,520
Just keep appearing in the background.

10
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,160
All right.

11
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,360
But I definitely.

12
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,080
I definitely have that advantage.

13
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,880
You definitely.

14
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,240
Well, no, at the moment.

15
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,140
At the moment, nobody knows that

16
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,320
anyone's playing this
game, which is brilliant.

17
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,000
Uhhuh.

18
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,000
So you're the first person to find out.

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,840
I've just been.

20
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,320
Hopefully in Gems video.

21
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,840
I don't know.

22
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,040
I think she was recording.

23
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,880
There's actually three tags because.

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,200
So it can keep moving.

25
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,200
Keep moving.

26
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,980
The game is very dynamic, and if it gets stuck on
someone, I can always add more tags because we could be

27
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,760
waiting a long time, and it'll be up to the audience
to help us know who actually got tagged and where it is.

28
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,040
So I've sent you a screenshot.

29
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,240
You see that in Discord?

30
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:52,770
Yeah.

31
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,130
That is so obvious.

32
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:54,770
Yeah.

33
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,530
I literally walked in holding
the tag, and you said nothing.

34
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,210
If you had said, what's that tag?

35
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,130
That name tag?

36
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,890
I'd have been done.

37
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,810
But you didn't say
anything, so we're all good.

38
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,930
It's just so normal.

39
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,770
It's so normal.

40
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,730
Of course it's normal.

41
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,130
It's not.

42
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,610
Don't feel like you've lost a game.

43
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,370
You haven't lost the game.

44
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,930
You didn't even know
you were playing the game.

45
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,850
No, but now I am,
and I'm gonna take it seriously.

46
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,370
Yep.

47
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,810
So pick your hermit
that you're gonna go for.
