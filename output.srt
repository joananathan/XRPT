1
00:00:00,320  --> 00:00:05,200
Somehow have unrestricted access to all
of the great pyramids of Egypt.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,240
Whoa.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,560
No.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,000
This is the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We'll be going into
the tombs of ancient pharaohs.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,280
Passageway we're in leads to what
Egyptologists say is King Khufu's tomb.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,840
The pharaoh who may have
ordered the pyramids to be built.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,720
Whoa.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,760
Hey.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,640
This room is called the Grand Gallery.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,160
What percentage of this pyramid do
you think we've seen so far?

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
We might never know
the answer to that question.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,340
That's the coolest way
he could have answered that.

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,500
This next room, the highest point

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,660
in the largest ancient pyramid on Earth.

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,140
Woo.

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,660
That was awesome.

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,940
Before we go explore the other giant
