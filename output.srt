1
00:00:00,320  --> 00:00:05,200
Somehow have unrestricted access to all
of the great pyramids of Egypt.

2
00:00:05,680  --> 00:00:06,240
Whoa.

3
00:00:06,240  --> 00:00:06,560
No.

4
00:00:06,560  --> 00:00:08,000
This is the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

5
00:00:08,000  --> 00:00:11,000
We'll be going into
the tombs of ancient pharaohs.

6
00:00:11,000  --> 00:00:15,280
Passageway we're in leads to what
Egyptologists say is King Khufu's tomb.

7
00:00:15,280  --> 00:00:17,840
The pharaoh who may have
ordered the pyramids to be built.

8
00:00:18,160  --> 00:00:18,720
Whoa.

9
00:00:19,280  --> 00:00:19,760
Hey.

10
00:00:20,560  --> 00:00:23,640
This room is called the Grand Gallery.

11
00:00:23,640  --> 00:00:26,160
What percentage of this pyramid do
you think we've seen so far?

12
00:00:26,160  --> 00:00:28,160
We might never know
the answer to that question.

13
00:00:28,900  --> 00:00:30,340
That's the coolest way
he could have answered that.

14
00:00:30,340  --> 00:00:32,500
This next room, the highest point

15
00:00:00,000  --> 00:00:34,660
in the largest ancient pyramid on Earth.

16
00:00:34,660  --> 00:00:35,140
Woo.

17
00:00:35,460  --> 00:00:36,660
That was awesome.

18
00:00:37,140  --> 00:00:38,940
Before we go explore the other giant

19
00:00:00,000  --> 00:00:40,740
pyramids, I wanna show
you guys base camp.

20
00:00:40,980  --> 00:00:41,940
Yeah, this is nice.

21
00:00:41,940  --> 00:00:47,220
We got a dinner table, some
tents to sleep in, and yo.

22
00:00:47,780  --> 00:00:48,260
Wow.

23
00:00:48,340  --> 00:00:48,980
Okay.

24
00:00:48,980  --> 00:00:52,180
We even brought lights so you
could see the pyramids from camp.

25
00:00:52,180  --> 00:00:54,580
That's gotta be the most
expensive nightlight that's ever existed.

26
00:00:55,220  --> 00:00:57,180
This is the pyramid
we're gonna explore tomorrow.

27
00:00:57,180  --> 00:00:59,540
I wanna start at 5am Everyone get some.

28
00:01:00,880  --> 00:01:05,440
These pyramids were so technologically advanced
for their time that some credit them

29
00:00:00,000  --> 00:01:10,000
to a pre Egyptian civilization, while some
point to even crazier theories, like aliens.

30
00:01:10,000  --> 00:01:12,460
But Egyptologists are sure
that they were built

31
00:00:00,000  --> 00:01:14,920
by the first Egyptians
as tombs for their kings.

32
00:01:14,920  --> 00:01:16,620
And by the end
of this video, we're going

33
00:00:00,000  --> 00:01:18,320
to find out which
of these theories is true.

34
00:01:18,400  --> 00:01:20,200
All right, boys, I hope you're ready

35
00:00:00,000  --> 00:01:22,000
to explore the next pyramid on our list.

36
00:01:22,000  --> 00:01:23,560
The pyramid of Khafre.

37
00:01:23,560  --> 00:01:26,080
What is special about this monstrosity?

38
00:01:26,160  --> 00:01:28,020
Well, this pyramid is how we learn

39
00:00:00,000  --> 00:01:29,880
how the casings of
each pyramid look like.

40
00:01:29,880  --> 00:01:31,880
This is how they all
look like at some point.

41
00:01:31,880  --> 00:01:33,620
That was right after
the aliens built them.

42
00:01:33,620  --> 00:01:34,460
No aliens.

43
00:01:35,020  --> 00:01:37,540
Rami led us nearly 100ft below

44
00:00:00,000  --> 00:01:40,060
the Earth's surface,
deep into Khafre's pyramid.

45
00:01:40,060  --> 00:01:41,940
This is a place where hardly anyone

46
00:00:00,000  --> 00:01:43,820
in the modern world has ever been.

47
00:01:43,980  --> 00:01:45,940
So to be honest, we had no

48
00:00:00,000  --> 00:01:47,900
idea what to expect going down here.

49
00:01:49,180  --> 00:01:51,100
The ancient Egyptians had cardboard.

50
00:01:51,820  --> 00:01:53,900
We believe that this was the burial

51
00:00:00,000  --> 00:01:55,980
chamber for King Khafre
for the longest time.

52
00:01:56,220  --> 00:01:58,140
And now they're using it to store stuff.

53
00:01:58,800  --> 00:02:00,640
Well, they're restoring
the pyramid, Jimmy.

54
00:02:00,640  --> 00:02:01,600
They gotta use tools.

55
00:02:01,600  --> 00:02:03,600
So that means there's
a real burial chamber.

56
00:02:03,600  --> 00:02:04,040
Yes.

57
00:02:04,040  --> 00:02:06,700
Rami actually took us
to the real resting place

58
00:00:00,000  --> 00:02:09,360
thought to have once held
the body of King Khafre.

59
00:02:09,360  --> 00:02:10,480
I see a big ceiling.

60
00:02:10,480  --> 00:02:10,960
Whoa.
