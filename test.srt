1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,692
For challenge number one, you can temporarily

2
00:00:02,692 --> 00:00:05,144
walk out of the Cube and attempt a free throw.

3
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:08,312
And if you make the shot, we will give a subscriber of

4
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:11,432
yours a free cybertruck and you'll be allowed back in the challenge.

5
00:00:11,496 --> 00:00:13,084
But if you miss, your subscriber gets nothing

6
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:15,272
and you are eliminated.

7
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:17,864
How did they get this many cybertrucks in one place?

8
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:19,496
I cannot make that shot.

9
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:20,616
It's too risky.

10
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:22,280
Free throw is so easy.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,096
Free throw is easy.

12
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:25,048
I could not have free throw to save

13
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:25,096
my life.

14
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:27,068
Everyone was on the edge trying to decide

15
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,968
if the first challenge was worth it.

16
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:31,144
But then Mark Rover did this.

17
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,240
Jimmy Peace.

18
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,740
I'm doing it.

19
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,764
No way.

20
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:39,988
Look at all the YouTubers in the background.

21
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,892
Oh, man, this is pressure.

22
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:42,836
This is a subscriber.

23
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:43,524
What's your name?

24
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:44,100
Matthew.

25
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,852
Don't let him down.

26
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:45,892
You gotta make this event.

27
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:46,996
I got faith in you.

28
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:48,276
It's on you, Mark.

29
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:51,064
Are you going to win your biggest fan a cybertruck,

30
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:53,700
or are you both leaving with nothing?
