1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,320
Babe, are you out here?
Yeah. I thought you might be.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,960
I have to go soon.

3
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,520
Okay. Can have coming.

4
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,120
Say goodbye to me. Coffee call. Would
you make one more? I finished packing.

5
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,973
Of course.

6
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,560
Car should be here in a minute. Oh,

7
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,523
thank you.

8
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,080
What am I going to do without
your coffee for five days? I.

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,960
Have coffee in London.

10
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,600
Do they? You sound really sure
for somebody who's never been.

11
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,920
Five days. I thought you said four. Yeah.

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,520
Four days there and then
I'm back on the overnight.

13
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,113
Right.

14
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,133
You can still come.

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,400
I can't. There's something I'm trying
to untangle at work. Oh, come on.

16
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,190
Just this once. Take a risk.

17
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,120
Next time. I promise.

18
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,440
This is a list of things that need to be
watered Thursday morning. Don't forget,

19
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,360
leave your key for Mike
and his son. The boiler.

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,193
Right.

21
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,880
Those should last until I
get home. Remind you of me.

22
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,000
Don. Need reminding you. Are.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,920
You sure you're going to be okay?

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,920
I'll be fine. Come on. Love you.

25
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,843
Bye.

26
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,533
Bye.

27
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,750
Go on Chuck. Hey. Hey. You just back
to him somewhere across the pond, man.

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,990
Everywhere. Nowhere. You know how
it is. Yeah. Buzzing in. Buzzing.

29
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,470
Now I got it. Day security debrief.
Then It's a home base. Man.

30
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,030
Go kiss my little girl. Oh,
that's important. Yeah. I just.

31
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,910
Say goodbye to my wife.

32
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,310
Hey man. What are you
doing for lunch today?

33
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,350
Nothing. No, no plans. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm completely free man.

34
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,830
That's great. I got this computer
shit. Just a few like bits and bites.

35
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,430
I would love to get that big brain of
ears to decipher. I swear last time bro.

36
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,263
You saved my life.

37
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,220
Yeah.

38
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,053
Yeah.

39
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,610
Of course.

40
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,470
That's great. Alright,

41
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,310
so you go ahead and you eat your
lunch then I'll come get you.

42
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,810
Yeah.

43
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,790
My man to take. Boom bro.

44
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,070
Four.

45
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,710
Minus two, operation

46
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,870
five, decryption and analysis.

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,990
Hello, are you there Charlie? What.

48
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,110
Do you have for me today?

49
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,710
2.1 Terabyte. Trench cobble station.

50
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,750
2014 to 2022. Open this alone.

51
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,430
No charge this time.

52
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,070
How's the weather in Istanbul?

53
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,333
Nice try.

54
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,150
It's just a matter of time.

55
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,070
You think it's been five years
Charlie, and you're still guessing.

56
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,230
I'll get there. I like puzzles.

57
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,190
Not as much as I like anonymity. If I.

58
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,590
Had to guess you're a 50-year-old
Russian man living in Istanbul with an

59
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,630
affinity for Reddit
boards and Turkish coffee.

60
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,350
Perhaps not. I'm serious.
Be careful with this data.

61
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,930
It's highly compromising for your agency.

62
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,130
Hey. Hi team. Tell me again.

63
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,770
How big did you say the crate was?
20 metres by 10. What of flavours,

64
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,603
hypotheticals,

65
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,400
satellite images of a crate on the back
of the semi-truck or angular in shape.

66
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,290
20 by 10 metres. Destination
a major metropolitan area.

67
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,850
La Wrong.

68
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,290
Coast is a truck from Pennsylvania

69
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,010
headed to DC so far so
good. A flag pole or.

70
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,843
Missile?

71
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,770
Christmas tree. The white house tree
always comes from a farm in Layton,

72
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,450
Pennsylvania. Dimensions
of the truck to arrest.

73
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,130
It can be really annoying sometimes.

74
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,290
Oh, who's that? The most dangerous man
in the building? Secret agent. Bang,

75
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,670
bang.

76
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,170
He and hell.

77
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,330
Are.

78
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,530
Besties. I best. No, just acquaintances.

79
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,293
How do you know him?

80
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,593
Save this life.

81
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,400
Heller.

82
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,330
What are you wearing.

83
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,413
Sarah?

84
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,743
No s.

85
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,513
He's dead.

86
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,250
Humour er. Right, right. I'm just
trying to let you know I'm here.

87
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,290
Right? I know, I know. I track you.

88
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,370
I'd be hurt if you
didn't grabbing a coffee.

89
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,730
Try to keep me awake a little bit longer
while I wait for the rest of the team.

90
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,250
Alright.

91
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,850
So go walk, go get some fresh air, honey.

92
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,210
But I want to lie down.

93
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,290
No, if you lie down you'll never get out.

94
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,010
Oh, is that sage advice
from the world traveller?

95
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,810
Harsh. Hey listen, I'm on something
here. Can I call you later?

96
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,593
Yeah.

97
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,930
I love you. Love you babe. Bye bye.

98
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,450
Bye bye. Bye-bye.

99
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,210
What the hell? There are witness
reports of a drone strike,

100
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,800
but US sources have confirmed
that it was a suicide bomber.

101
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,920
The scale of the attacks 50
people killed including French

102
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,753
special forces.

103
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,570
Seven. Danish Marines were
killed in the explosion,

104
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,800
which was initially reported
as a misdirected airstrike.

105
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,890
Department of Defence spokesman denied
reports of US Air Force operations in the

106
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,650
area blaming the attack on
local insurgents. Chief Moore.

107
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,370
Hey buddy. Carlos, you okay?

108
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,290
You look like a damn ghost.

109
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,650
I was just rectifying
some Charlie. Some files.

110
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,210
Okay. I may have looked somewhere I
shouldn't have. Within a department,

111
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,970
grey area. We don't.

112
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,040
Do grey areas. Charlie,

113
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,010
in that case what you
do is you keep quiet.

114
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,650
Hey, I am either busy or drop
my cell at the bottom of my bag.

115
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,770
Tell me who you are
and I'll call you back.

116
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,490
Hey, it's me miss you.

117
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,650
I water the flowers first thing.

118
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,930
Chief Moore, Charlie,

119
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,680
sorry I don't see you down here
very often, sir. Why would you?

120
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,610
Nice office you have. Yeah, if you
don't like sunlight or fresh air

121
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,530
for a moss or Liken or Charlie,
have you been tracking the news?

122
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,610
I'm still trying to find
an outlet I can trust.

123
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,050
That's what we thought when we
heard you were here this morning.

124
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,050
I need you to come with me to
the director's office please.

125
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,483
Director.

126
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,570
Director O'Brien. This is Charlie Heller.

127
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,680
Hi. Hello Charlie. Come have a seat.

128
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,450
I'd.

129
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,283
Rather not.

130
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,370
Mr. Heller, I'm afraid there
was a situation in London.

131
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,753
Have you heard.

132
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,910
London?

133
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,770
An attack at the Christopher Street Hotel.

134
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,073
Charlie.

135
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm very sorry. Mr. Haller.

136
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,850
Your wife has been killed. No, she's
at a conference. We should call her.

137
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,753
Charlie. I'm.

138
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,610
Can call her give. I have to call her.

139
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,610
Charlie. I think you need to see this.

140
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,410
We're following a breaking news story
here in London where a terrifying

141
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,290
hostage situation unfolded at the
Christopher Street Hotel. Earlier today,

142
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,970
four assailants stormed into the
hotel taking a number of individuals

143
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,450
hostage. Two individuals
sadly lost their lives,

144
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,930
including an American
woman who was taken during

145
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,130
believe inside the hotel.
The perpetrators forced.

146
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,610
This is footage we pulled
from surveillances. Terror.

147
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,510
It. I got the.

148
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,790
Tirelessly. Locate the ass,

149
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,230
secure the rescue and
release of the hostage.

150
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,360
How can they not no
more? This was in London.

151
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,840
947,000 cameras. They drove into traffic.

152
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,400
Nobody is getting away with
this. You have my word.

153
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,823
Okay,

154
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,200
tell me what we know so far.

155
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,320
Mr. Haller with respect.

156
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,520
Let us handle this. Forgive me sir.
I don't believe we've officially met.

157
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm the one who's going to ensure that
those who did this are held to account.

158
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,140
What would that look like,
sir? With respect being held.

159
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,940
To account. Look, we can't
get into specifics yet.

160
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,930
Of course you understand that.

161
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,530
We'll tell you what we can as
soon as we can. He said what?

162
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,530
He said. Only nicer. Go home.
Charlie, you need to take some time.

163
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,310
Next of Yes.

164
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,670
The suspects arrived via the
service entrance around 1100 hours.

165
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,190
The vehicle had been stolen overnight
at about oh 1 24 in the east end.

166
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,830
Prince DNA all professionally
scrubbed out four person team

167
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:42,980
appears.

168
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,710
They had a meeting with impact
investments out of Indonesia on our radar.

169
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,870
This is when it all started.
Something must've got heated inside.

170
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,460
It spilled out into the corridor.

171
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,670
Impact security detail got jumpy and
one of the four drew on him. One dead,

172
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,030
one critical hotel security are alerted
and the police have been called.

173
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,150
Suspects are now in a race to leave the
building and they decided to grab some

174
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,983
insurance.

175
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,190
They only took Sarah because
she tried to save someone else.

176
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,330
The man who took Sarah is Mishka Blage
origins in Belarus though often based

177
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,130
in Moscow. This led the conference
room with three hostages.

178
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,570
This man Lawrence ish is South
Africa ex Special forces.

179
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,810
Ellis seems to handle
shipments for the wider group.

180
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,960
Armed police and security
were arriving from St.

181
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,610
Pinecrest station but were ordered
to hold back because of the hostages.

182
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,570
Police sealed off the area
Marks men in position,

183
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,610
but the suspects are exposed and they know

184
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,860
Sarah's killer is harder to track.
She seems to sense the cameras.

185
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,540
She says nothing, but I processed
all the CCTV cell phones,

186
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,490
dash cams,

187
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,270
body cams and the audio to give us
a 360 and that provides us with an

188
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,910
id. This is hors Schiller.

189
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,870
Loose affiliations with dozens
of Mercks and defence groups.

190
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,230
I'm still filling that in.

191
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,030
They seem to be operating as interface
between bad state actors and terrorist

192
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,830
entities. All business and
they keep getting hired.

193
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,270
But for this one, I have a
current location. Gretchen Frank,

194
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,590
former Armenian io.

195
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,630
She's in Paris Plaza Bread at this cafe.

196
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,830
Turns out they're regularly.

197
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,980
You knew this. Thank you.
We'll do a comparison. Wait.

198
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,030
You already know about Gretchen Frank.
I understand you want to see progress,

199
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,863
Charlie,

200
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,270
but sometimes the best course of
action isn't always the most obvious.

201
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,870
Most obvious. We want the whole network.

202
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,070
The network has nothing to do with Sarah,

203
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,070
but everything to do with the
sovereignty and security of this country.

204
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,710
What you do is very important
to what we do. Charlie,

205
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,270
we think it would be good
for you to see Dr. Garrison.

206
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,590
Am I here for me or the agency?

207
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,550
It is important we assess you're well
enough to return to work obviously,

208
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,950
but you suffered a terrible
loss and we want to support you.

209
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,910
Can you describe your feelings right now?

210
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,390
You mean denial, anger, acceptance.

211
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,803
Say more.

212
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,453
Gone

213
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,480
and that she had to go like that.

214
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,330
And that I didn't speak to her
on the phone when she called.

215
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,480
And you blame yourself.

216
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,473
That yes,

217
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,530
for not going when she asked
me to because I never did. I

218
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,213
never did.

219
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,970
What is that making you feel?

220
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,200
Pretty useless and angry.

221
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,120
Very, very angry.

222
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,050
I gave the agency the names of
Sarah's killers. They did nothing.

223
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,370
What do you want them to do?

224
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,530
Their job? I want them to
go after Sarah's killers.

225
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,480
Will that make you feel better?

226
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,770
It shouldn't be about me. Sarah mattered.

227
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,170
She deserves more.

228
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,730
But in the end, this is about you.

229
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,393
Sarah's gone.

230
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,970
You are going to have to try
and come to terms with that.

231
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,810
I can help but only you can
really make things better.

232
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,340
Decryption and analysis.

233
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,480
You've been very quiet
lately. Guess where Olivia?

234
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,050
You.

235
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,170
Good here for a minute buddy? I got
to close up the back. Oh yeah, yeah.

236
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,450
I got you covered on me.

237
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,050
Floor seven executive.

238
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,170
I'm holding the highlights
of over 100 eyes only cables.

239
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,240
These are double coded from a
data cache out of cobble station.

240
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,170
These are the official cables, same dates,

241
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,090
same events except for very key
information that has been altered

242
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,170
or completely scrubbed from the record.

243
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,530
What are you talking about?

244
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,370
This is your coverup. Have you
lost your mind? To put it mildly,

245
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,570
it's your order of operations
to destroy a hospital in Syria,

246
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:35,240
an allied base in Yemen, an Afghani
politician's house. You have no idea.

247
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,050
Border.

248
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,883
Crossing and Somalia.

249
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,970
I count more than 1000
casualties and over 400.

250
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,410
Civilian fatalities.

251
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,930
It's only out of respect for your recent
loss that I'm not throwing you out of

252
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,050
this office. I'm just going to tell
you, you don't have a goddamn clue.

253
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,103
See right here.

254
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,330
The convoy. You targeted our allies.

255
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,370
You post flagged it.

256
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:02,010
You got them all fired up and then sucked
them right back in where you wanted

257
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,650
them. You were forcing Mission
Creek. Okay, that's enough.

258
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,010
That's enough. These were
not operational choices.

259
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,520
You sir,

260
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,330
made political decisions and
your signatures are all over

261
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,490
these here and here and here you are so,

262
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,530
so far above your pay grade.
You're right. You're right.

263
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,530
Maybe we should take this
up with the director,

264
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,850
let her call it.

265
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,890
Or maybe it's fair for the times
of the post it's been to the press

266
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,530
with this, you'll go
to jail, idiot. Maybe.

267
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,970
But we'll all be there together.
We have a mission here.

268
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,210
A responsibility will defend our
nation by any means necessary.

269
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:54,610
I don't think Mr. Heller came here to
debate ethics and practises, right?

270
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,893
Right.

271
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,530
First you need to know that
I've set up a dead man switch.

272
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,610
If I don't code in every five hours,

273
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,810
these files will automatically be sent
to three top investigative journalists

274
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,450
along with a detailed report and
timeline of the events. 24 hours later,

275
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:16,490
the files will be released to the
public. I get it. We kill you Wolf.

276
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,810
Blitzer wins an Emmy. No, not
just kill me. You put me in jail.

277
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,890
You blackside me. You extradite me.

278
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,010
You'll only condemn yourselves
then what the hell do you want?

279
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,770
He wants us to kill the people
who killed his wife. No, no.

280
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:35,130
I don't want you to kill them.
I want to kill them myself.

281
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,490
I beg your pardon. You heard me?

282
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,530
I want to find and kill the
people who murdered my wife.

283
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,930
CIA will train me.

284
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,690
I mean, this is a practical joke, right?

285
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,370
I don't think you could beat a
90-year-old nun in an arm wrestling match.

286
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,130
That's.

287
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,170
Funny humour.

288
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,210
I want mission specific training and
all the information the company has on

289
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:08,090
these people. Cash and a new
identity, A legend. Anything else?

290
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,610
An Aston Martin, a jet pack. Maybe.

291
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,970
I want a fighting chance.

292
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,270
How do we know we really
set up the dead man switch.

293
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,430
We don't need to keep a lid on this.

294
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,190
Right? So let's play along.

295
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,390
Until we're sure what actually train him.

296
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,390
What arm can it do? Probably
quit him his own accord.

297
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,190
Meanwhile get park on. I
can't believe I'm doing this.

298
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,390
We scrub his life till we
find a switch. If it exists.

299
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,310
If it doesn't, maybe
there's a training accident.

300
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,110
Let's use Henderson.

301
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,010
Charles.

302
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,843
Heller.

303
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,210
Charlie, you're late

304
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,910
with respect.

305
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:47,760
I'm actually about you
are late. You coming?

306
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,500
The hell you doing? I'm
not an Uber driving. Sorry.

307
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,073
On the left.

308
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,260
My bad is he's bluffing.

309
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,740
Man has an IQ of one 70. Let's not assume.

310
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,860
The only way out is through security and
there's not a chance he got past them

311
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,700
with a digital file.

312
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,980
We wise are standing in blind spots
for over 40 minutes. Here, here,

313
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,620
here on this day

314
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,860
and look at that.

315
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,860
Sweat. Yeah, that's a lot of sweat.

316
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,900
Are you my handler?

317
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,980
I am Colonel Henderson.
My friends call me Endo.

318
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,300
You will call me Colonel Henderson.

319
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,340
I have been asked to give you a refresher
course even though what you'll learn

320
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,380
here is outside the normal
curriculum. Next to God Almighty.

321
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,780
I am the most important person in the
world to an operative looking to target

322
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,300
enemy combatants do precisely as I say.

323
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,610
And there is a slight chance
you may come out of this alive.

324
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,140
Oh man, slide channel is overestimating
your odds to extra complex.

325
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,380
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give us the room.

326
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,260
Go have coffee now.

327
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,900
Wait, you think you used a skimmer? They.

328
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Don't work on these drives.

329
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,260
They work on printers.

330
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,820
Six days ago he sent the files to the
printer and skimmed them with a magnetic

331
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,340
strip. Rewrote the
software in the printer.

332
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,780
Doesn't mean he got the strip
out of the building. Okay,

333
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,260
so A MPR has a saw at Best
Buy at oh nine 17 on the 13th

334
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:12,570
where he bought the magnetic strip,
then got gas, copy the files at 1103,

335
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,570
met you to the next morning.
If he smuggled it out,

336
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,903
he did it.

337
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,043
Here.

338
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,570
Still screener picked up nothing.

339
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,610
Maybe he swallowed it. Still.

340
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,443
Would've picked it up.

341
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,190
Kind.

342
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,300
Fog you stand right there.

343
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:57,670
Hold you. Try closer. Just a few rounds.

344
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,190
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
did we test your vision?

345
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,470
I guess I just have to get that close.

346
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,190
Yeah, point blank range. Might
have a 50 50 chance of hitting.

347
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,750
So overestimating my aunt.

348
00:36:55,250 --> 00:37:00,230
So an IAD consists of an
initiator switch, main charge,

349
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,430
power source container for enhancements.
Stuff like fertiliser, nails, glass,

350
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,790
ammonia, nitrate. Beauty is you
can use what you find bigger,

351
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,990
small as you like. Improvise,
design it for your purpose.

352
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,910
Carry the components with you.

353
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,150
I'd be damned. Looks like we finally
found something you do well, Heather.

354
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,990
Man, I keep this. Sure.

355
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,270
He went here twice this bar. What.

356
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,150
Once with Mr. Do Menez
on the night of the 24th.

357
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,470
A couple of weeks after his wife died.

358
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,590
And then again the next month, the 13th.

359
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,950
That he downloaded Fox.

360
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,860
Right? He searched it though.

361
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,630
Let search it again. Name Clark
Nicholas Jensen. Spell that for me.

362
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,190
J-E-N-S-O-N. You sure?
Yeah. Not Jensen Clark. No,

363
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,340
Clark Nicholas Jensen. Where were you
born? Raleigh. Raleigh. North Carolina.

364
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,630
Which hospital now? Duke University
Hospital. Your mother's maiden name?

365
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,030
Deborah J Hammock.

366
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,403
Just a sec.

367
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,270
It's all being re swept. Even the
parking lot. There's no drive here.

368
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,630
Okay. That's what we didn't
find. But what did we find?

369
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,790
I don't know. This was
stuck under the jukebox.

370
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:30,950
Give me.

371
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,783
A quarter.

372
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,410
You are not a killer.

373
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,970
No. Hey, who's this? Leave them. Oh,

374
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,650
these are the assholes
that killed your wife. Huh?

375
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:13,570
So how do you plan to take them
all out? The first one you kill.

376
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,570
You let the other ones know you're
coming and then what's your plan?

377
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,490
How are you going to keep the
people at Langley off your ass.

378
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,650
That's what I need you to teach me.

379
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,023
All right. I'll teach you.

380
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:28,890
Take.

381
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,930
It. I'll come. Come on. Take it.
What is it? What do you take it a now

382
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,970
pointed it at my chest.

383
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,610
Pointed it at my chest. Do
it now. All right. All right.

384
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,970
Put your finger on the trigger.

385
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,290
Come on, look at me.

386
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,970
Come on. Come on. Charlie.

387
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:10,090
Paralysing, isn't it pointing a
live weapon at someone like that?

388
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,340
You have to either be very
confident or very stupid,

389
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,020
which is its own kind of confidence.

390
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,610
Truth is you don't have that kind of
confidence and you are not stupid.

391
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,740
Not in the slightest. You're
just not a killer. Charlie.

392
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,660
People have certain gifts.

393
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,860
You can't do what I do no
matter how much I train you,

394
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,380
as much as you can't teach
me how to break code.

395
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,300
I can't make you into something
that you're not. I'm sorry.

396
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,570
When the time comes,
I'll pull the trigger.

397
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,860
When the time comes,

398
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,780
you won't even remember which end
of the gun the bullet comes out of.

399
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,220
How long is this going to take.

400
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,260
With this encryption? Four or five hours.

401
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,500
What if she can't break
Heather's encryption? She will.

402
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,900
How do we know he didn't
make 50 copies? We don't.

403
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,260
Allie we're in. What's a bluff?

404
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:32,050
He was playing us and he did pretty
well too. Take him off the board.

405
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,353
Yeah.

406
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,073
Okay.

407
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,553
He's gone.

408
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,250
He's got a bag full of passports.
Even hacked biometrics. Yeah.

409
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,610
Got out on the janitor
card. This is a joke.

410
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,130
Maybe y'all misjudged this
individual. You think.

411
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,860
He knew exactly what he was
doing after chasing breadcrumbs?

412
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,750
That's long enough while he
got himself some training.

413
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,390
Mr. Heller bugging a CIA officer.

414
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,803
Is treason.

415
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,373
From Washington?

416
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,990
Yes. Okay. You can open them.

417
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,880
Happy birthday.

418
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,773
Did it crash?

419
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,640
Apparently it wasn't tied down properly
and got thrown around in a tornado or

420
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,840
hurricane or something. What do you think?

421
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,800
I have no words.

422
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,800
Yeah. Yeah. Not crazy.

423
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,020
It needs some work.

424
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,580
This is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

425
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,283
Yeah.

426
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,530
Yeah. Second most.

427
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,490
Happy birthday.

428
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,503
He is in London.

429
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:01,050
One of his passports just lit up
an immigration on his way to Paris.

430
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,210
I'll grab local liaison. No,
this stays with us. What.

431
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,770
About Anderson? Call him.

432
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,920
Hey there. Lock pick fans. Okay.

433
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,520
Today we're going to pick
an apartment style lock.

434
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,960
So the first thing we're going to do is
you're going to take your tension wrench

435
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,930
and you're going to stick it in the bottom
of the keyhole and the plug just like

436
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,770
so feel it. You're going
to apply just a little,

437
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,050
a little if you don't want too, too much.

438
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,250
And what's going to happen is the pins
are going to bind up on you and you won't

439
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:47,170
able to get up and you're not
going to get in that door.

440
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,730
Go gently,

441
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,290
gently and feel it right
back and forward carefully.

442
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:56,723
A light touch.

443
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,570
All the pins are going to
line up and then you're in.

444
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,450
There you go. How to pick a
lock? Pretty darn easy. Yeah,

445
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,283
don't forget to like it.

446
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:23,003
Yes.

447
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,670
And flowers. Excuse me.

448
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:31,670
All of them please. The
lilies as well, please.

449
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,030
Okay, I'll of them.

450
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,630
You must have done something really bad.

451
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:40,890
Not.

452
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:41,723
Yet.

453
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,030
Who are you? Tell me
where Horse Schuler is.

454
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,863
And I'll let you out.

455
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,310
No, that's not going to work. Open the
door. I'm sorry. Not until you tell me.

456
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,470
Please just tell me where he is.

457
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,950
Because you killed my
wife. Her name was Sarah.

458
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,830
Tell me where he is. Tell me.

459
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:33,030
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

460
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,373
Hello.

461
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,030
What do we know about Gretchen Frank?

462
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:43,110
Our people say one of her own folks
ran her down most likely fallout

463
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:44,790
from when the London job went south.

464
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,390
I'll let state know. French
ambassador is asking.

465
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:49,523
Wasn't us.

466
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:16,490
You want a beer? Yeah, that's true.

467
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,170
Do a headache. Single play.

468
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:27,170
How did you find me phone?
You pulled off Gretchen Frank.

469
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,730
It's like a radar thing. Doesn't
matter how smart you are,

470
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:35,530
you panic. That will always
screw up a good plan.

471
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,210
Then there's the survival
instinct. No one goes down easy.

472
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:50,550
Of course,

473
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:54,290
the aftermath when you realise you've
done something you can't undo ever.

474
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:59,890
You can know that. You can't.

475
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:05,930
You surprise me Charlie. I
can't tell you how rare that is,

476
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,650
but it ends here.

477
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:12,770
There are no three volley
salutes in this work.

478
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:18,410
We're the John Doza get found in the
dumpster if we get found, which you won't.

479
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:24,263
I'm sorry.

480
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:32,170
Those were good lessons.
You're a good teacher.

481
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:36,610
I took that into account.

482
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:43,530
50 50 Odds, right? Did you
ever account for things?

483
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:48,730
I was good at base charge on a timer.

484
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:59,930
You have one new message. Meet ottoman.

485
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,370
Cargo hanger seven.

486
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,130
They're expecting you you'll
need 500 euros in cash.

487
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:20,770
You have one new message.

488
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:26,290
The Ari Cafe Cab Low Street.
I will pass you a book.

489
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,330
Wait is not who you're looking for.

490
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:26,773
Check your phone.

491
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:50,270
It was reckless of you to come
here. Whatever your reasons.

492
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,040
Does I need your help.

493
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:56,800
No, you have nowhere else to
go. It's not the same thing

494
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,720
for shopping. Give me your backpack

495
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:13,400
and your hat. Why you look less American?

496
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,383
What do you want?

497
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:19,920
My wife was murdered.

498
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,080
I know about your wife in Paris.

499
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:25,783
That was you.

500
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,600
I need to find the happens. No, not here.

501
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:34,960
There is a parking garage four blocks
from here. That way. First of all,

502
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,480
put some shopping,

503
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,880
then meet me there in half an hour and
if you're not followed, we'll talk more.

504
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:05,530
So how long has it been you?

505
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:11,850
Six years. My husband was
the CIA asset former KGB.

506
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:17,170
He was inline until he died.
He fell out of a window.

507
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:20,103
I'm sorry.

508
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,730
Accidental falls from windows are the
number one cause of death of former KGB.

509
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:24,783
He didn't know.

510
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:29,690
He thought to me everything he was
doing how the mine that the K cash

511
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:34,050
encrypt files. After he died,

512
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:38,490
I decided to keep up my connection to
your department in case I needed help.

513
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,330
Which is why I always thought you were
a middle-aged man because you were to

514
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:44,163
begin with.

515
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,850
You weren't exactly what
they pictured either.

516
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:49,930
How did you picture me?

517
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:53,730
I dunno. Mr. C, the gun. I guess.

518
01:07:57,390 --> 01:07:58,223
So. You'll help me.

519
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,050
It is better than any alarm system.

520
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:35,770
This is the first place I've stayed in
for more than a month in the last three

521
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:39,370
years. I don't sleep,

522
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:42,810
but I just don't want to run anymore.

523
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,650
What makes you think
they won't find you here.

524
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:53,810
For that night when they do.

525
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:56,480
Really think you're going to
fight off the Russians with that?

526
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,930
It's not for them, it's for me.

527
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,730
Those are the three, correct?

528
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,930
Yeah. Schiller seems to be
the coordinator, ringleader,

529
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:13,600
but he's also the most difficult
to profile as far as I can tell.

530
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,050
They operate as middlemen
in the proliferation. Shame.

531
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,090
And just like the data you showed me,

532
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:20,970
they also source mercenaries
for director Moore's Black Ops.

533
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:24,810
Ellis sources the weapons,
but he's beyond paranoid,

534
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,690
so we have to find a way to
pull him out of the dark.

535
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,600
Okay, perhaps I can start
the conversation, suggest
I have a contract for him.

536
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,010
See if he will engage.

537
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,170
Okay. And this is mish bla
seems to be based in Moscow,

538
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:43,210
but he likes to keep on the move,
enjoys his luxuries, travels everywhere.

539
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:47,050
First class, he may be the
weak link. Even posts online.

540
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,850
This is just last week, no location,

541
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:54,520
but the vineyard on level ground and
the spacing's wider than typical.

542
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:58,690
So probably hotter climate.
Chalky soil may be granite,

543
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,370
low sun hitting the wine in his glass.
But the vineyard would be angled north,

544
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:06,730
south. So it's sunrise. And this church,

545
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:10,250
the architecture looks
Spanish so hot in October,

546
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:15,090
maybe Central Spain and here in
the reflection girlfriend maybe.

547
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:25,410
And there she is. Alexandra Voya,

548
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:30,250
who also likes to travel
S Madrid last week.

549
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:34,810
We need to project everything
that makes America great,

550
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:36,810
but we need to do it openly.

551
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:38,210
We have to assume he's still alive.

552
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:43,690
He has three targets we need to
locate and get eyes on all of them.

553
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,600
This agency will be worthy of
the nation's trust within our

554
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,520
country and beyond. We
will be accountable.

555
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:54,560
Saw your speech. It was excellent.

556
01:10:55,630 --> 01:11:00,410
You know are the first
person my predecessor briefed
me on about the stick up

557
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:03,410
your ass on isis, A aq,
Iran counter-terrorism.

558
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,210
Even now, three years
after mandatory retirement,

559
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:09,450
they keep looking the other way.

560
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:14,930
But it's housekeeping time and
I need to know where you stand.

561
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,410
Sounds like you're suggesting
it's time for me to go private,

562
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,560
write a neat book about
my time with the company.

563
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:27,480
Yet here we are enjoying
this lovely meal. So why?

564
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:31,170
Oh please. I'm new, but I'm not stupid.

565
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:35,450
I need you to be accountable to me.

566
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,970
Stop playing your black ops in the sand.

567
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:43,010
I need to be across everything
and I mean everything.

568
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:53,520
Hey Brian, can you bring me another
one of these sourdough roll thingies?

569
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,290
Sure. I'll tell you a story.

570
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:03,010
Your predecessor sat me down
at this very same table,

571
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:08,410
no more than a week into his
term and gave me pretty much this

572
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:11,480
exact same speech. Oh wait,

573
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:16,770
maybe it was his predecessor.
I can't remember. Anyway,

574
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:21,480
I'll tell you what I told
them. You have my full support.

575
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,273
Good.

576
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,713
Good talk.

577
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:33,290
Enjoy that pasta.

578
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,733
Where?

579
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,063
Return.

580
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:45,970
On whose orders grill.

581
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:47,003
Lunch date.

582
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:52,890
Let's get someone of our own in play.

583
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,130
At the ELAR Hotel. Five
stars, nightclub rooftop pool.

584
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,033
What?

585
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,290
Langley will be onto him too.

586
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,480
Then would keep tracking him
until we have a clear field.

587
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:25,050
No, I'm going.

588
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:32,050
Okay. And keep an eye out for him.

589
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,130
This is who they was telling.

590
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:11,690
He is a night swimmer. He pays the
staff to clear the rooftop for him.

591
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:29,040
Light the sky pool is suspended.
16 stories about the ground,

592
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,560
which is 70 metres.

593
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:35,840
The thickness of the clear glass will be
420 centimetres in total made of three

594
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:38,040
panels with air gaps.
To improve the strength.

595
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:41,270
The pool will be three metres
tall, five metres wide,

596
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,960
and can hold an impressive
150 tonnes of water.

597
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:48,480
You could shoot them from there.

598
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:51,040
From You haven't seen this shoot.

599
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:57,480
Not for me to say here, boss. But why
bury him? Why don't I just roll him up?

600
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,720
We're past that. We're
too big of a stench.

601
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,560
Look, he practically invented
half of our surveillance tank.

602
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,493
Now I will find him.

603
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:07,270
You might have a bigger stench on your
hands if he gives us the slip again,

604
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,480
you won't let that happen.

605
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:15,350
Charlie Heller.

606
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:32,300
Okay. You're going to have to clue me in.

607
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,810
Integrity. It's all about integrity.

608
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,100
Dev, morals, something like that.

609
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:42,060
Yeah, and something else as well. If
I have the math right, I should move.

610
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,660
Can I confirm the pool
will be ready as usual.

611
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,433
Oh my God.

612
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,700
Second stool down at the bar.

613
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:41,850
Yeah. What about him?

614
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:44,340
He's been following me. I've
clocked him three times.

615
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:46,940
Where there's one. There's always more

616
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:54,760
shit. You're right. Of
course you're a man.

617
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,680
He's in the lobby moving
across towards the elevators

618
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:02,640
in a minute at the bar. I
have an idea on him. Charlie,

619
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:07,920
he's also CIA. You have
to leave now. Heller.

620
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,130
Are you listening to me? No.

621
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:12,850
No. We was planned.

622
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,450
Tell me where to find horse
Schiller. Who are you?

623
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:53,010
You held the gun to my wife's
head. She was terrified.

624
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,690
You have the wrong gun. Yeah. Yeah.
I know you didn't pull the trigger.

625
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,290
So tell me where to find him.

626
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,330
This is a joke. I don't get it.

627
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,553
It's not a joke.

628
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,850
This is a remote that controls the
device that's been decompressing the air

629
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:11,250
between the sheets of glass
beneath you. If I trigger it,

630
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:16,450
the glass will shatter. So tell
me where he is or swim very fast.

631
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,520
You have the wrong person. No,

632
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:24,130
I'm exactly the right person.

633
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,010
Charlie, you should
get out of there. Shit.

634
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,560
Henderson headed your way.
Go towards the stairwell.

635
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:07,733
Where is he now?

636
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,050
He's in the stairwell. Three floors
above head towards the basement.

637
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:12,050
There's an exit in the back.

638
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:28,480
Shit. There's another one already in
the basement. He's coming towards you.

639
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,170
Which way? Left. Go left.

640
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:40,010
Where is he? The other one? I
don't know. I'm looking right now.

641
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,450
Stop. Stop, stop.

642
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:57,223
You.

643
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:10,190
You got to get out of there.
You've got to go right now.

644
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:24,790
You wanted to see me?

645
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:25,853
Have a seat.

646
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:32,220
Where's Charlie Heller?

647
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,020
As far as I know, still
on bereavement. Leave.

648
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,580
You talked to him at all.

649
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:40,460
We thought it best to give
him some space for now.

650
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:42,343
Makes sense.

651
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:44,810
I'll let you know if we hear from him.

652
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:10,980
There. See that? Yeah. What is he doing?

653
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:15,810
His lips are moving. Look in his
ear. He's talking to somebody. Oh.

654
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:24,810
Hotel security was hacked yesterday,
right time. 1107. It was a pro job.

655
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,220
The origination is murky at best.

656
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:28,620
Stanbul perhaps.

657
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:29,923
Talk to me.

658
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:31,163
From hella.

659
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,580
If I had to guess your 50-year-old
Russian man living in Esam

660
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:37,843
ball.

661
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:43,140
In line code, name in
line. Locate this person.

662
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,233
How are you feeling?

663
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:03,940
Good. I don't know. I didn't
screw up so much this time.

664
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:08,520
Not such that a good thing, right?

665
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,810
Excitement. Feeding the birds.

666
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,250
When my husband was murdered,

667
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:23,210
I wasn't prepared for how
quiet the world would become.

668
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:29,130
Songs that a person makes
in life. The rhythms

669
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,210
that you expect. A certain song
that a certain time of day.

670
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:37,560
The door footfall

671
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:41,650
stupid thing used to do that annoyed me

672
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:47,370
and suddenly there's nothing.

673
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,810
Just great silence

674
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:57,853
for me.

675
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:02,050
Every moment since it's been
about trying to fill in silence.

676
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:09,540
You need to ask yourself doing all this.

677
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,540
Is it how you should fill yours?

678
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:29,670
Code name XFSB by way of the KGB.

679
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:34,150
Flip to us. Oh four.
Deceased in 17 deceased.

680
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:37,230
The Russians suspect his widow
may be operating in his place.

681
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,150
The Russian station chief in Istanbul.

682
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,810
What's on? What's on?

683
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:09,580
I want nothing from you.

684
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,700
I just want to sleep for one night
with another person beside me.

685
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:20,843
Okay,

686
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,553
come on.

687
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:52,460
It's okay. It's.

688
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:57,420
Okay. We're okay. We're okay. We're.

689
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:14,493
Okay.

690
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,310
Heller's in Berlin. What?

691
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:31,400
This was 40 minutes ago.

692
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,823
Yep.

693
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:04,250
Put the money on the chair. Count it.

694
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:07,250
Nothing until I inspect the hardware.

695
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:11,370
Hardware's right there. Go
ahead. Stay on the phone.

696
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,210
Shit. You just armed an IED. It's
on a beam trigger. You drop the lid,

697
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:21,170
move away or cross the beam. It detonates.

698
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:27,050
Who the hell are you? Do you honestly
think I came here alone? Look.

699
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:27,883
At the photograph.

700
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:31,370
See it. Do you see it?

701
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,560
Yeah, sure. I see the photograph.

702
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:38,200
You recognise her London baby.

703
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:43,130
That's Sarah. You took
her life for no reason.

704
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:47,343
Wasn't me.

705
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,970
Okay. I didn't shoot her. Fine.

706
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:53,410
Just tell me what I need to know and
I'll deactivate the device. Alright?

707
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,050
Okay. Come on. Come on. Where.

708
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:56,370
Is he? Schiller. Where is he?

709
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,930
It's impossible, man. After what happened
to Gretchen and Blasik, he's gone.

710
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,113
Horse's gone.

711
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:04,730
Well then you are of no
use. No, wait, wait, wait.

712
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:12,560
You beat sea, right? He stays on his
boat. Which sea? I know Russian waters.

713
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:17,090
That's 25,000 miles of coastline.
Which seed? I don't know.

714
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:21,050
Russian and Walters. Not good
enough. Too vague. Come on man.

715
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:25,770
You supply him with this shit,
right? These missiles, correct? Yeah.

716
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:27,130
So where do you deliver them?

717
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,810
A port on the Btic. Primos. It's there.

718
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:41,890
Cafe. He calls in there and that's it.

719
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:46,730
How do you contact him? He
uses two numbers for his man.

720
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,930
If they get the right codes, they
know it's me. That's all I have.

721
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:53,890
We'll see. Give me your phone. Your phone.

722
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:04,220
Numbers are there. Codes
are by their names.

723
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:15,420
Their names Simon and Christophe.
I'm not messing names.

724
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:20,420
Simon and Christophe. Come on. See
you. Right. See, I'm not lying.

725
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:22,060
That deactivate this thing.

726
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:29,140
There. There you go. There
you go. You jump really fast.

727
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:32,540
You might survive the blast. Please. Wait,

728
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:35,283
wait.

729
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:47,590
We got a ping in Rome. The little prick
is now at a museum. He's not in Rome.

730
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:49,830
Chasing papers

731
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:56,150
because the shovelling what's left
of Mr. Lawrence ish out of the mud in

732
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:56,850
Romania.

733
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:58,560
He just got on a tram and Prague.

734
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,960
I need to sleep again.

735
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:07,370
Are you kidding me?
What do you think, man?

736
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:10,250
Just coincidence or what?
Somehow I doubt that.

737
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:11,983
What'd you say? Maybe.

738
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:15,930
Let's go get us a cup of shitty
Russian coffee. Huh? Come.

739
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:16,763
On.

740
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:21,890
Let me get you in the big bad city. Come
on, let's go. So wrap it on the run,

741
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:22,783
huh?

742
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:39,330
You're.

743
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:42,210
Here to kill me. It's
not really what I do.

744
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:46,560
I might sit you up to get killed.
Facilitated. What are you looking for?

745
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:52,730
I know. My assassin. Your
assassin. What do you think?

746
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,890
What does an assassin look like? I
mean, it can't be anyone, huh? I mean,

747
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:01,010
even a slight little nerdy fellow
likes to work on computers.

748
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,250
Only thing dangerous about him is he's
got this dream about rehab and assassin

749
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:09,010
just to fly it around to prove
to himself that he's not afraid.

750
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:19,370
These are killer, by the way.
I'm going to show you something.

751
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:25,250
Oh, I handed it to you. I
almost didn't recognise you.

752
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:30,690
I said to the team Now there's no way
a him. What do you want? Honestly?

753
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,410
Sure. Saved your life.

754
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:36,850
How are you going to do that?

755
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:41,890
Chuck? You killed three people. Are
you done? Have you had enough? No.

756
01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:44,010
I want the guy who pulled the
trigger. I want 'em all. Damn.

757
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:46,410
Dude, that's pretty cold blooded.

758
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,890
You think they're going to
let you leave Russia? I mean,

759
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:51,490
how does that even work?
How do you leave here?

760
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:53,050
The only way you leave here is in a box.

761
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:58,050
But if you walk out of here right now
with me, I can help you. Nobody sent me.

762
01:39:58,190 --> 01:40:01,730
I'm here on my own. Shit. Maybe
you got a future in this field.

763
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:03,930
Maybe we can figure something
out like that. Hon. Just come.

764
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:06,250
With me. I have a future in the field.

765
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:09,930
I could have sworn you just
said, I have no future.

766
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:11,870
Look,

767
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:14,290
I'm not going to sit here and pretend
like I understand what's going on with

768
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:17,250
you. I don't. Okay? I've never
felt that you're lost. I get it.

769
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:20,890
But you honoured her.
But you think she wants,

770
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:23,770
you think she wants to die here
in this country. But these people,

771
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,600
she would want you home. Man,

772
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:30,643
I can't come home.

773
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:36,643
She's not there.

774
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,340
Okay. You keep your head on
a swivel now. Okay, Chuck.

775
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:10,663
Listen

776
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:58,530
sir. I'm sorry.

777
01:41:58,990 --> 01:41:59,490
Do you speak.

778
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:00,323
English?

779
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,050
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry sir. I'm.

780
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:07,850
Sorry. There were two men with you on a.

781
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:17,420
It is not very impressive. Is it place.

782
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:19,810
Near the cargo? You have
below those hatches?

783
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:23,340
I think I might even
feel a little insulted.

784
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:29,900
Who's coming after me? Me,
me. I'm coming after you.

785
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:34,420
And who is running you? You're afraid?

786
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:38,340
Director Moore has finally decided
to call it quits. Have you shut down

787
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:41,180
whatever you think you know.

788
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:45,260
I know more and Caleb hire you and your
outfit to carry out black ops for them.

789
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:46,173
I have proof.

790
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:51,380
But that's not what this is about,

791
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,340
is it? No.

792
01:44:58,060 --> 01:44:59,740
I came here to face my wife's killer.

793
01:45:02,490 --> 01:45:07,020
Took him in the eyes and
tell him she mattered.

794
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:14,540
Sarah mattered. So it is just you

795
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:20,540
Britain, Blage ish.

796
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,460
The men that they sent off to you.

797
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:28,420
This whole thing is all your
revenge. Charlie's revenge.

798
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,753
Please.

799
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:48,180
I remember your wife.

800
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,300
She took the place of someone
else. It was very, very brave.

801
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:59,340
I'm sorry she died. But it was

802
01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:03,980
necessary. The police
had blocked our exit.

803
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:10,140
They had to demonstrate what would
happen if they did not allow us

804
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:12,460
to leave. That's it

805
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:16,923
necessary.

806
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:22,420
You are not so different to me
killing these people to find

807
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:27,300
your way here to me. Has
it made you feel better?

808
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:30,380
I want not to have killed you.

809
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:38,220
It was an instant, your wife.

810
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:41,980
It wasn't that you tortured
my colleagues. Dropped a man.

811
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:46,900
16 stories suffocated a
woman in a locked chamber.

812
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,650
You had the more unarmed, defenceless,

813
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,770
staged your elaborate
murders from a distance.

814
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:55,303
And you know why

815
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:00,083
I do?

816
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:04,600
Because it's hard to take a life a close.

817
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:09,890
You lose something each time.

818
01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:13,890
A piece of yourself you
cannot get back ever.

819
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:18,890
And you've lost so much already.

820
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:23,850
So you had to give them a chance
to escape the mouse trap to run

821
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,090
just fast enough.

822
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:31,850
Because then you can tell yourself
there's no blood on your hands.

823
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:35,090
But it doesn't mean you're weak.

824
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:39,890
Just means you are not truly a killer.

825
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:44,560
Don't believe me.

826
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:03,930
Go ahead. You are here to
kill me and take it. You see,

827
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,560
it's not a trick here,

828
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:16,450
right then and did face to face.

829
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:24,100
Friend of mine once told me I'd
never be able to pull the trigger.

830
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:29,900
But he also said I'd
never be able to kill.

831
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:12,023
There.

832
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:16,433
That's what I,

833
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:20,850
to balance the scales

834
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:27,600
to make you feel. What
she felt in that moment

835
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,560
before you killed her

836
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:05,893
big steward.

837
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:14,600
Taken us on a detour, huh? Bullshit.
I've taken control of your boat.

838
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:17,350
You've just reached, finished waters.

839
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:24,800
That is not possible.
The chiefest of fault.

840
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:29,440
Your own CIA insisted upon
it using encryption. I wrote,

841
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:34,480
it's all running from my hotel room.
These two may have smashed my phone,

842
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:37,350
but they held onto theirs and my watch.

843
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:42,600
So I'm the transmitter
and you invited me in.

844
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:46,240
I just needed you to talk as
long as it took to get us here.

845
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:53,000
That would be the finished
Navy and Interpol.

846
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:54,880
I gave that dislocation.

847
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:15,800
Down. Stand down, down.

848
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:32,850
When I took up this role,

849
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:39,420
I made it clear to everyone who works in
this building that even though our work

850
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:42,260
sometimes goes on in dark corners,

851
01:52:42,450 --> 01:52:47,050
that is no excuse to allow
darkness to obscure our objectives

852
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:48,383
or our methods.

853
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:54,890
So I'm deeply saddened to have to tell
you that information has surfaced that

854
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:59,170
implicates senior members of this
agency in carrying out rogue missions,

855
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:04,250
which put the safety of our own operators
and agents we work with at great risk.

856
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:09,010
Gentlemen, the cost of winning
the war cannot be our honour.

857
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:14,450
Those operations were not
sanctioned. They were illegal.

858
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:17,890
And those individuals will
face the full force of the law.

859
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:20,370
I'll now take questions.

860
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,090
Washington Post.

861
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:25,770
I understand these arrests are linked
to a series of killings in European

862
01:53:25,770 --> 01:53:29,410
cities. Last year was the CIA
involved in those operations.

863
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:31,290
You would not expect me to answer that.

864
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:35,050
NBC is the whistleblower
still employed by the.

865
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:35,883
Agency?

866
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:40,850
I can confirm that the officer is safe
and that they will continue to serve with

867
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:41,683
the.

868
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:26,490
Who's the Uber driver. Now.

869
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:30,210
You must be running out of lives.

870
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:34,090
And you keep on surprising me, Charlie.

871
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:38,690
Everything you taught me. No, no.
What you've done, what you've become.

872
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:40,730
You can't teach that.

873
01:54:42,990 --> 01:54:45,790
I guess I just suddenly saw
what needed doing. Yeah.

874
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:50,470
When no one else did. Thank you.

875
01:54:57,450 --> 01:54:58,230
See you around Charlie.
