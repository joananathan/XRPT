00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,320
What if I told you that I consume knowledge like no one

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,320
you've ever met and I've actually passed the bar?

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,480
I'd say you're full of crap.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,160
That's a Barbary Legal handbook right there, right?

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,000
Open it up.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Read me something.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,680
Anything.

Civil liability associated with agency is based on several factors, including the deviation of the agent from his

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,120
path, a reasonable inference of agency on behalf of the plaintiff and the nature of the damages themselves.

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,580
How did you know that?

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,340
I learned it when I studied for the bar.
