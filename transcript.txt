Samsung is working on a transparent phone and you might be thinking, I feel like I've heard this news somewhere before. 160-6160
Well that's because they started registering patents for it seven years ago. 6480-10560
They've registered more patents in 2018 and then again literally a couple of weeks ago. 10560-14880
All of this points towards one thing that we don't know when it's coming. 14960-18160
We actually don't even know if it's coming. 18160-19920
But we do know that behind the walls of Samsung HQ this is being worked on now. 19920-25120
As someone who's grown up watching a lot of sci fi where it's practically a stereotype of the future to have transparent displays and transparent ph, it is crazy to me that this isn't fiction anymore. 25120-35580
Literally last month Xiaomi announced a transparent tv. 35660-38780
You can go into their store, demo it, you could take one home if you like it. 38780-41980
It is a real product, a device that can display a vibrant OLED picture and then when it's off, just disappear into a razor thin sheet of glass. 41980-50220
I mean I say that, but I'll be the first to admit that this particular usage case is not a smart idea. 50300-55740
I think a living room TV system is probably one of the top five worst use cases of of a transparent display. 55820-62100
Because you generally sit a TV in one spot and then never really move it. 62100-65780
You're not going to notice the transparency unless you get up and walk around it. 65780-69380
And because it's probably sitting in your living room, chances are all it's going to do is remind you what the back of your wall looks like and potentially even remind you of that spaghetti of cables you had behind your screen. 69460-80260
Plus, the recommended usage scenario for transparent TVs right now is making sure the wall behind is dark. 80340-85860
But think about that for a second. 85940-87510
If the wall behind your TV is dark, it might as well not be a transparent TV. 87510-91670
Now. 91670-91950
It actually would make sense if it was like a fitted panel, something that people could install in a place where they were going to have glass anyways. 91950-97830
But it just so happens that that glass is also their tv. 97830-100630
But anyways, yeah, I'm not hugely sold on that idea. 100710-103350
And to be really fair, in all of these sci fi movies, as prevalent as these see through displays and see through phones are, there's never really an explanation as to why. 103350-111350
I feel like a lot of people are convinced that this is is the future, but often just because, well, it's futuristic but that in itself is just a self fulfilling prophecy. 111430-121400
Yes, it's a screen protector. 121640-123560
I'm going to roll with it. 124120-125160
So is A transparent smartphone any better? 125240-127720
I would argue yes. 128600-129960
And I do think it's possible. 130360-132280
The idea would basically be to have a transparent display and then all your transparent components sitting directly behind it, and then all the things that you couldn't make transparent shove them into the bezels. 132520-142490
And I get that this sounds like science fiction, but we are getting there. 142490-145610
Transparent circuit boards are a thing. 145610-147370
Transparent cables are a thing. 147370-148970
Even transparent batteries are starting to become a thing. 149130-152170
So, yes, whilst a fully transparent phone is going to take time, I'm just saying that I think it's plausible. 152330-157529
So why would you want one? 157850-159210
Oh, and if you're enjoying this video, by the way, a sub to the channel would be miraculous. 159290-165210
Now, there is already the very obvious perk of transparent is cool. 165610-169250
And if you gave me a couple of hours, I could probably name you 100 products that are found in on this premise alone. 169250-174190
But to be fair, I think with transparent phones there is more to it than that. 174190-177350
There's a minor safety benefit. 177430-179190
People walk around the street staring at their phones. 179190-181110
You could argue that if your phone is transparent, you'll at least have some awareness as to what's happening around you. 181110-185910
But also, if we just take a closer look at the patent Samsung's been filing, some of them detail a display that can, because it's transparent, be used on both the front and the back. 186070-195110
It might mean that you could use your phone normally without obstructing your view with a finger. 195350-199190
It might mean you could effectively pinch objects. 199190-201430
You'd almost have another dimension when interacting with digital content. 201430-204390
This device right here, for example, was something created by Japanese mobile operator docomo, where you could, for example, use one hand on the back to hold a Rubik's Cube still and another to rotate parts of it like you would in real life. 205010-216530
And just bear in mind that that demo was from 2012. 216690-219490
There is the obvious problem with a transparent device, that whatever's happening right behind you might interfere with what you're trying to see. 219730-225970
But we already know that this is a solvable problem, because glass can tint itself. 226050-230610
Transparent display. 231000-231880
Glass can adjust its transparency on the fly. 231880-234360
You've seen that OnePlus concept, one phone, right? 234440-236720
It actually employed this exact technique, darkening its glass to make its cameras disappear from view. 236720-241720
But all this stuff is fairly minor. 241880-243560
I think the big selling point of a transparent phone is augmented reality. 243560-247400
See, even now, we can play games like Pokemon Go with these virtual creatures running around in our real world, we can scan text in a foreign language and convert it to our own. 247560-255480
We can measure the distance of real world objects, but in the current way that this is done, there's a disconnect between you and the real world that you're interacting with. 255480-263810
What you're actually seeing is not really what's in front of you. 263810-266330
It's just a representation of what's in front of you shown on a screen, which in itself is just information displayed by the camera of your phone. 266330-273849
It doesn't feel real. 273849-274930
It doesn't feel like your reality is actually getting augmented. 274930-278130
But with a transparent phone, you can bypass all of that. 278210-281650
Imagine literally just holding up this digital pane of glass and seeing those objects alive right in front of you. 281730-287360
It would be the next level of immersion. 287360-290320
All that said, I don't think transparent phones are going to become a thing. 290960-294640
See, two of the biggest, most persistent trends in technology are that A, people want to be as connected as possible. 294800-301600
Always online, always just one interaction away from other people, and B, at the same time, more than ever, people want immersion. 301920-309120
A way to lose themselves in digital worlds that feel as real as possible. 309120-312480
That's why people love VR so much. 312830-314350
But where do these two things lead us? 314510-316910
Because then they almost kind of seem like contradictions. 316910-319630
Like, how can you be always connected and always interacting with other people if at the same time you're sunk into a digital experience? 319630-326190
Well, I would argue that it all leads us to a mixed reality, a world where digital becomes fused with the physical. 326910-333390
You are completely immersed, but at the same time, so is everyone else. 333390-337310
So you're always connected. 337550-338990
And there are huge benefits to this. 339150-340750
You wouldn't need road signs to know where you're driving. 340750-342710
You wouldn't need great weather to be able to look out the window and see a bright sunny day. 342710-346450
You'll be able to learn everything you need about an item in a shop before you actually pay for it. 346450-350410
And most importantly, Pokemon Go could actually be what it was in the initial trailer. 350650-355050
With people wandering around their real world, catching seemingly real Pokemon. 355050-359690
That's a dream. 359850-360730
And I do get that at the same time, this sounds just as terrifying as it is exciting. 360810-365050
So if you do want a full video, kind of delving into the meat of it, let me know. 365290-368570
But what I think is that by the time we see this in real, products that you can actually go out and buy will be ready for it and people will want it. 368570-376410
So with all that in mind, yes, a transparent smartphone would be a step above a normal phone in immersing you into this digital world. 376570-383690
But there's a competing product that would be two steps above augmented reality glasses. 383930-390090
If the real world is merging with the virtual, then it makes complete sense for you to be able to access this through something you can wear, as opposed to something you have to hold. 390170-397850
Instead of having to install a transparent display in my car, 15 in my house, and then 100 in my shop, it makes sense to just have one transparent display that can do everything, and it makes sense for that display to not be on a smartphone, but to be on your face. 398090-413020
Plus, by the time a transparent phone is completely viable, I think we'll already be on our third generation of AR glasses, so I don't think they'll even be given enough time to become a thing. 413180-422300
I suppose the next step above glasses would be something implanted inside of you so that you could still interact with the digital world. 422300-427420
That is definitely a different video. 428200-429560
