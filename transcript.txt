It's Mumbo and Grian time. 80-1280
Hungry Hermits has been on the hermitcraft server for months now, and I've been way too scared to play it. 1280-5560
I'm bad at games, I'm bad at organizing things, and I'm bad at communicating with people. 5560-9840
All things that are very important for Hungry Hermits. 9920-12880
But when I found out Grian hadn't played Hungry Hermits either, I realized there's a golden opportunity here. 12880-18000
So we're getting together. 18000-18720
We're going to play a couple of rounds. 18720-20000
The first few rounds are going to be on my channel. 20000-22400
Prepare yourselves. 23280-24080
And then the second set of rounds are going to be on Grian's channel. 24240-27240
And hopefully by then we'll. 27240-28540
We will have slightly improved. 28610-29770
Now, for anyone unfamiliar with Hungry Hermits, it's a game a little bit like overcooked. 29770-34210
You have a handful of tables. 34210-36290
The tables gradually fill up with customers who are demanding meals. 36290-40050
You then have to prepare those meals using things found within the restaurant. 40210-44370
And there's a number of time traps and obstacles and things that you have to do. 44449-49090
Essentially, this game is about organization, keeping a level head, and managing tasks effectively. 49090-54930
All things that me and Grian, and not exactly famous for. 54930-58750
So after our initial play test with Tango went incredibly well. 58750-62350
Oh, I've got. 62590-63270
We've got a customer. 63270-63990
You gotta let me out. 63990-64750
How do I let you out? 64750-65590
Where's the button? 65590-66190
Oh, my goodness. 66190-66710
Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. 66710-68190
I'm. 68190-68470
I'm a bit chilly. 68470-69270
Oh, my goodness. 69270-69750
We've got. 69750-70070
We've got. 70070-70390
We got. 70390-70750
Our brains have just got. 70750-71430
We've got orders. 71430-72190
Oh, wait, we missed them. 72590-74630
I didn't even see what our first order was. 74630-76510
Yeah, that was very quick, to the point where I feel like that was. 76670-80270
Oh, I think we just lost. 86750-87870
Good luck to you. 87870-88750
Thank you, Tango. 88910-90030
Yep, we won't need it. 90030-91310
We got raw talent on our side. 91470-92990
All right. 95950-96430
The game's broken again. 96430-97390
Having broken the game in three different ways that Tango had never seen before, it was now fixed and time for our first proper session. 97870-103990
Three, two, one, go. 103990-106350
It works. 106830-107630
Yeah? 108350-108910
Yes. 109550-109950
That's good. 109950-110510
That's good. 110510-110990
Start. 111070-111390
Right, okay, we stand on the pressure plates. 111390-112830
Have you got your. 113310-114030
You've got your. 114030-114550
Your locks and stuff? 114550-115390
Yeah, yeah, got locks. 115390-116860
Okay, Slots. 116860-117820
Cool. 117900-118380
Proactive, proactive. 118780-120180
I went straight in the freezer. 120180-121540
Yeah. 121540-121740
Okay, you know what to do. 121740-122700
I need to get. 122700-123420
I need to pick up the item frames. 123420-124860
Bam, bam, bam. 125180-126540
Lovely, lovely, lovely. 126540-127740
And then it was order dog treats. 127740-129540
Right, I'm gonna try and I'm gonna try and get a pork chop as well. 129540-133500
Yeah, dog treats. 133500-134460
Always dog treats. 134460-135420
I'm feeling more positive right now. 136060-137740
What? 138140-138540
What? 138540-138940
Well, I. 139660-140300
I failed to get the pork chop. 140460-141820
Okay, I'm coming out the freezer. 142540-143540
Okay, cool, cool. 143540-144220
I couldn't get the pork chop. 144780-146060
End rods are the worst thing that's ever been put in this game. 146380-149020
They are rough. 149020-149780
1. 149780-150100
I got one fish. 150100-151180
Okay, well that's. 151420-152340
That's for level one. 152340-153380
I think that's actually. 153380-154140
Alright. 154140-154620
Anyone. 154940-155460
Anyone in the restaurant yet? 155460-156740
Nothing yet. 156740-157260
Nothing yet. 157260-157700
But I've got a dog treat. 157700-158620
So do you need. 158620-159340
Do you. 159500-159940
Who's going farmside? 159940-161100
I'll go far. 161500-162100
I'll go farm. 162100-162860
And I think we should cook potatoes for us to eat. 162940-165900
Yes. 166300-166820
Get that in early. 166820-167740
Someone's in. 168750-169310
Yep, yep, yep. 169390-170590
It's Cub. 171390-172190
What does he want? 173470-174270
He wants carrots. 174350-176270
Okay, that's. 176350-177230
That's like. 177230-177790
That's manageable, right? 177790-178830
That's manageable. 178830-179550
I'm just ordering tons and tons of dog treats. 182510-184910
Carrots. 186270-186910
Oh, oh, oh. 189550-191150
Silverfish. 191150-191790
Who else we got? 191790-192510
Oh, gosh. 194030-194910
These things are so difficult to fight. 194990-196510
Okay, we've got a new person. 197780-198820
It's vintage beef carrot. 199860-204580
Done. 204900-205300
Are we. 205300-205740
Are we crushing it? 205740-206380
What is your beetroot? 206380-207180
Beetroot, beetroot, beetroot. 207180-208340
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. 208340-209260
Oh, here's some more dog treats. 209260-210820
Should I go into the. 211220-212580
These carrots to eat? 212740-213780
Yes. 213780-214140
Yeah, yeah. 214140-214580
Why not? 214580-214900
Hold on to those. 214900-215580
Yeah. 215580-215980
Just in case someone else wants a carrot. 215980-217380
Oh, we got item frames, don't we? 217460-219060
Yes, yes. 220260-221620
This door is the worst thing ever. 221620-223220
It is difficult. 223220-224180
Oh, why am I. 224420-225260
You know what? 225260-225660
I'm feeling less stressed this time for some reason. 225660-227620
Exuma's here. 227620-228580
Hopefully he wants a carrot. 229300-230380
That would make my day. 230380-231300
He wants a melon slice. 232580-233860
That's easy, right? 233860-235020
Like I can just ride the mine. 235020-236300
Should I ride the minecart over? 236300-237460
Yeah, you can. 237460-238060
Yeah, yeah, you can do that. 238060-239220
That would actually make my life a bit easier. 239300-241020
Nice. 241020-241540
It's actually. 242260-242860
It was already broken for you on the other side. 242860-244660
Easy job. 244660-245300
There we go. 245620-246340
See, now I feel like we're. 248420-249660
Now I feel like we're crushing it. 249660-251140
Oh, the phone. 255380-256380
The phone. 256380-256980
I've hit the button. 258740-259700
Is this the Krusty Krab Mumbo? 260370-264370
Wait. 266290-266650
Oh, I didn't get the beetroot. 266650-267850
Oh, wait. 267850-270210
Are we meant to know what that phone just said? 270210-272290
Why grin? 273330-274690
Are we meant to know what the phone? 274690-275650
I don't think so. 275650-276450
I have. 277410-278170
I think I failed because the beetroot. 278170-280010
I didn't Actually, get the beetroot. 280010-281410
What. 282450-282810
What have you done? 282810-283490
Open the door for me. 283490-284370
Oh, my goodness. 284370-285250
Yeah, I'm still on the pressure plate. 286440-287800
Oh, that's a good idea. 288200-289160
That's a good idea. 289160-289960
Oh, people are grumbling. 290680-291720
Did you hear that? 291880-292400
Yeah, yeah, it's. 292400-293720
It's. 293720-293960
It's beef. 293960-294440
He wants his beet. 294440-295320
I was chillin. 297400-298440
I was chillin. 298440-299200
I thought we were fine. 299200-300160
Wait, melon slice. 300160-301120
Wait, who wanted the melon slice? 301120-302520
Beetroot and water. 302920-303760
Beat Beetroot again. 303760-304600
Beetroot again. 304600-305320
I. 305320-305560
I got a water bottle. 305560-306520
I'm gonna have to get a bucket. 306520-307800
Okay. 308040-308600
We weren't prepared. 308920-309960
Oh, we have to fill up the cauldron. 310120-312040
Right? 312250-312410
You take these potatoes, dude. 312410-313570
Well, actually, let's cook these potatoes because I'm gonna. 313570-315650
I'm hungry. 315650-316170
Oh, my goodness. 316330-317050
Everything's flying on the ground. 317050-318810
Right? 319530-319810
Okay, I'm gonna. 319810-320410
I'm gonna throw this stuff on the ground. 320410-321770
Right, like, that's the thing that we can do, isn't it? 321770-323850
Yeah, but the rats. 324010-324810
The rats. 324810-325250
Yeah, but we can throw it in the farming area. 325250-326970
Oh, man. 328810-329610
Okay. 329770-330250
Someone's gonna get angry soon. 330250-331530
Matt. 331530-331890
We got melons and I got melons and carrots. 331890-333730
I've thrown those on the ground. 333730-334890
Did you pick up the bucket in the glass? 336810-338450
Or have we lost the bucket but not the glass bottle? 338450-340730
Oh, someone's getting ang. 341370-342890
All right, I've got the glass bottle again. 345750-347270
Okay. 347670-348070

I've got our potatoes. 349390-350470
Beetroot. 354230-354870
I'm on the beetroot. 354870-355670
Right. 355670-355870
The glass bottle should be coming. 355870-357110
Why is it not coming? 357510-358710
Have you got it done? 359270-360790
Did a rat pick it up? 360790-361830
Order another one. 361830-362470
Order another one, I think. 362470-363470
Oh, no, it's over here. 363470-364550
How did it end up over there? 364870-366150
Grant, wait. 366790-369110
We're fine. 369110-369590
We're fine. 369590-369910
Oh, my goodness. 369910-370630
I think gen. 371790-372430
Oh, my goodness. 372510-373270
I think we almost lost then Jen, genuinely. 373270-376550
Jen was, like, looking at the floor. 376550-378430
Right, I've got. 380030-380910
I've got baked potatoes here. 380910-382270
Have you got it? 384990-385790
I'm getting that. 386350-387230
Where's the beetroot? 388990-389950
I don't. 391550-392270
Clearly don't know the stages of beetroot. 392350-394350
The phone's going. 395230-396070
Oh, is that my dog? 396070-404050
Take. 404050-404330
Take. 404410-404810
We're in trouble. 405130-405930
Well, we am. 406250-407250
I meant, am I. 407250-408090
What's happened? 408250-408970
What's happening back there? 408970-409810
Graham, the dog won't. 409810-410770
I can't get any more. 410770-411930
The bone meal. 412490-413450
How are we doing, Graham? 415850-417050
He is staring at his toes, mate. 417050-418810
He's staring at his toes. 419130-420330
Oh, I should have opened the door. 421130-422210
I should have got that in early. 422210-423290
Come on, come on. 424100-425380
I can't make this door open any quicker. 426020-428740
Go, go, go, go, go. 430420-431620
Take it. 431620-432340
Yes. 432900-433380
Oh, that's it. 433380-434380
Day one. 434380-434860
I think we did it. 434860-435460
I think we did it. 435460-436100
Do you need a baked potato, mate? 436100-437460
Yes, I do. 438500-439300
Have. 441780-442180
Have we done it? 442500-443220
I think. 443220-443620
Yeah, I think so. 443780-444740
Oh, my goodness. 445300-446340
Oh, man, I'm sweating already. 446500-448900
Yeah. 449380-449740
I mean, that day one felt like it went on for an eternity. 449740-452660
How did we struggle that much? 453140-454580
Are we. 455140-455540
Are we allowed to do stuff at the end of the day? 455540-457540
I'm guessing not. 457540-458420
Right? 458420-458740
Yeah, I feel like that feels like cheating. 458980-460620
Right. 460620-460980
Well, all I was gonna do was fill up this bucket. 461700-464340
Yeah. 464980-465380
I mean, look, I'm getting overtime. 465380-469300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 469300-470740
Overtime. 471060-471620
That's like getting paid some overtime. 471780-473420
That's. 473420-473620
That's typical in kitchens, right? 473620-474740
I hear that, like, kitchen staff work overtime all the time. 474740-477220
There we go. 477220-477780
That's all. 478180-478700
That's all I was gonna do. 478700-479780
Right, let's go. 479780-480460
I think that's perfectly fine. 480460-481700
Yeah, I think that's okay. 482020-483580
What's our upgrade? 483580-484660
Extra hot bar slot. 484820-486220
Yes. 486220-486660
That's actually huge. 486660-487780
Yes, yes. 488260-488980
Go for that. 488980-489540
Go for that. 489540-490140
Except that. 490140-490820
Right. 491140-491460
How do we do? 491460-492100
I guess we just. 492900-493580
Do we just do that manually? 493580-494620
Free up. 494620-495060
Free up a slot? 495060-495900
Yes. 495900-496340
This is the best day of my life. 496660-498020
Okay. 498020-498340
Do we just throw it on the ground, you reckon? 498340-499940
Oh, I just. 500180-500820
I've just stacked it with another one. 500820-501980
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. 501980-503060
I mean, what's stopping us from what we're doing overtime? 503540-507420
I mean, I guess we could give ourselves loads of slots. 507420-510200
Right. 510200-510400
Let's go. 510400-510760
Let's go. 510760-511240
Okay. 511240-511680
Day two. 511680-512200
Okay, Are we gonna do the same thing? 512360-513680
Are you gonna go straight in the freezer? 513680-515000
I'll go straight in the freezer. 515080-516240
Let's see if we. 516240-516880
I mean, it's just a hazard, isn't it? 516880-518240
It's just a guess. 518240-518960
I'm gonna go straight, but I still haven't got the knack of. 518960-522440
Is it the chicken one? 523560-524600
The end rods. 525400-526280
Okay. 528920-529360
I am doing tons and tons of rotten flesh. 529360-532680
Yes. 534200-534640
Yes. 534640-534960
Okay, I got the pork chop. 534960-535960
You got it. 535960-536320
You got it, right? 536320-537060
Do you want me to make my way over? 537060-538060
I'm running. 538220-539020
Running. 539660-540340
Okay. 540340-540860
I got you, buddy. 542700-543660
Open. 543980-544380
That was synchronized. 545580-546660
That was perfectly in sync. 546660-548020
I feel like we're. 548020-548700
We're in a good. 548700-549340
We're in a good space here. 549500-550540
Cooking pork chop. 550620-551580
Cooking fish. 551580-552380
I'm going to the farm. 552700-553820
I'm going to make my way over to the farm as well. 553900-555860
Cuz I think I left some stuff on the ground. 555860-557740
I got us some bone meal. 560380-561660
Is this the crusty crab? 562790-563750
Right? 565190-565590
Why do you keep saying that? 565670-566950
This is. 566950-567510
What's that a reference to SpongeBob? 568390-571830
Well, I know it's a reference to SpongeBob. 571830-573470
Like I've watched a lot of SpongeBob in my time. 573470-575110
I'm trying to think because Patrick's at the phone and people are calling at the restaurant. 575110-579830
No, this is Patrick. 582310-583670
Right. 583910-584190
I'm gonna make myself. 584190-584910
I'm gonna make my way back. 584910-585910
Right. 587510-587830
We actually haven't seen, seen if there's any customers. 587830-589970
I have beetroot seeds, by the way. 589970-591850
You need them. 591930-592650
Okay. 592650-593090
But yeah, there's, there is a dispenser, so I don't think that's, that's wise to hold on to. 593090-597370
Yeah, so we have customers. 597690-599890
We've got two. 599890-600490
We've been slacking a little bit. 601130-602490
Okay, Beetroot. 604010-606090
Yes, that's a win. 606090-607210
And just done that. 608090-609370
Wait, I've messed it again. 609370-610730
Oh, we've got two lots of beetroot, mate, we are in the money here. 611850-614890
I've got a bunch of bone meal. 615230-616430
That's actually not that great because. 616750-618270
Is it not then? 618270-619230
No, because I've got nine bone meals. 619870-621910
Potatoes. 621910-622510
Are you got. 622510-623510
Oh, you actually have beetroot. 623510-624790
Not seeds. 624790-625390
No, no, no, no, I've got no seeds. 625790-627630
Wait, do we have any seeds? 627710-628990
Wait, did you serve them beetroot? 629470-630790
No. 630790-630950
You did not? 630950-631550
No, no. 631950-632990
Should I, Should I bone meal? 633310-634550
This stuff? 634550-634950
What is this stuff? 634950-635790
So the mistake I keep making is not enough bone meal. 635790-638710
On, on them. 638710-639350
Yeah, bone meal. 639350-640190
Okay, yeah. 640350-642240
Is that enough? 642560-643200
Yeah, that's two beetroot. 643840-645000
You don't serve them there. 645000-646160
Actually, I might set up more. 646240-647680
Do you need, do you need more boneless? 647760-649000
Do you need more bone meal? 649000-650160
Oh, great, great. 651280-652160
If you're going through, if you're going through, you might as well take my beetroot and you just threw them into the. 652160-656080
You just threw them into the hopper. 657840-659360
I think, I think we might have just lost. 660960-662800
No, I think, yeah, I think we just lost. 663760-666160
No, yeah, seriously. 666320-668590
But why? 668910-669550
Because there's hoppers there, so you can't throw items through the open door. 670190-673870
Yeah, he made the same mistake. 676830-678070
Plant the be root the beetroot. 678070-680430
One. 681310-681710
One. 681790-682190
Okay, go and serve the one that's hungriest. 682270-685070
Oh, there's lots of tapping. 686030-687390
There's a lot of the door. 687390-688590
Why is someone at the door? 688590-689590
What? 689590-689870
Why did the door open and close? 689870-691230
We lost. 691870-692430
Oh, we totally lost. 692670-693870
Do you know what I think that came down to beetroot. 694850-698050
Yeah, Beetroot. 698290-699130
Beetroot did us in. 699130-700210
Oh, mate. 701810-702690
Yeah. 703570-704130
You know what? 705490-706130
At no point were we doing well there. 706290-708450
No, we were both in the farm. 709170-711410
There was no point in which we were working. 711970-714290
Did anyone want this cooked pork chop or cooked cod that I spent ages getting? 714370-719170
I mean, I was just rolling the dice a little bit. 719170-720850
We weren't working effectively there. 720850-722450
And I'm trying to think what we can do better. 722770-724690
Try, I guess. 727010-728050
But that was me. 728770-729930
Max effort. 729930-730770
That was. 731490-732050
That was max effort. 732130-733490
Yeah, well, we made the same. 734290-735490
We've done the learning now on Beetroot beat. 735650-737890
Root isn't like wheat, where it's just like 1, 2, 3, done. 737890-740170
It's like 1, 2, more, more, more, more, more. 740170-742610
Done. 742610-742930
Yeah. 743090-743570
Be root. 743570-744170
Be root. 744170-744570
Needs a lot of bone meal. 744570-746370
Oh, that was difficult. 746930-747970
Right? 747970-748170
You need to make sure that you put your. 748170-749410
Your slots back. 749410-750090
We even had extra slots. 750090-751410
I so thought we were. 751410-752730
We were fl. 752730-753410
Oh. 754830-755030
Should we try again? 755030-755710
Yeah. 755710-756110
Okay. 756110-756510
Okay. 756510-756870
Right. 756870-757070
I'm feeling good, though. 757070-757750
I'm feeling good. 757750-758430
My sweat level has decreased slightly. 758430-760510
The game is working on this one, I reckon. 761950-765070
Level three. 765230-765950
All right. 766030-766590
Level three. 766750-767390
We can make it. 767390-767870
Look, we haven't made it past level. 767870-769230
The door. 769710-770310
The phone is already going. 770310-772110
Right, you answer the phone. 772110-773150
I'll get. 773150-773670
I'll get some meat. 773670-774670
Oh, we didn't check our school. 775390-776670
It was bad. 777710-778350
I'll be honest, Mambo, I don't think we need to. 778510-780950
Yeah, it was probably bad. 780950-782030
Right? 782870-783030
If we. 783030-783430
If the next. 783430-783910
Oh, you are kidding. 783910-784950
What's happened? 784950-785750
It like, it did a tick of damage and moved my cursor. 786550-789470
I'm getting out of the freezer. 789470-790590
I can't. 790590-790910
I cannot beat these end rods. 790910-792630
Yeah, there's got to be. 793750-794790
Wait, is that. 794950-796390
Is that. 796390-796830
Is that flood? 796830-797670
Wait, it's flooding. 801270-802190
Grian, you need to. 802190-802950
I'll go. 803350-803990
How have we had this stuff already? 806150-807670
All right. 808870-809070
Okay. 809070-809390
Okay. 809390-809670
We saved it. 809670-810310
Who's in here? 810630-811550
There's no one. 811550-812150
Customers. 812470-813030
We're almost. 814630-815270
We're almost gone. 815270-816030
Is already right. 816030-817350
I've got three of the bone meal things. 817350-819350
Should I go? 819430-820070
Okay. 820070-820470
Speak to the dogs. 820470-822870
The minecarts. 822870-823630
Not here. 823630-824070
Oh, you'll have to use the door. 825350-827430
Right. 827430-827750
Does it not take a pearl's order? 827750-829190
Does it not come. 829190-830030
You left. 830030-830390
You'll just act. 830390-830910
No, you'll have to use the door. 830910-832070
Okay. 832150-832710
Water bottle. 832790-833750
I can handle that. 834070-834990
Water bottle. 834990-835750
You handling that? 835990-836790
Yeah. 837550-837870
Now, I don't know if this is. 840430-841550
This is sneaky, Graham, but we do have Some. 841550-843630
Some items left on the ground from the last run. 843630-845710
What else do I need? 845710-846710
So I just need bone meal. 846710-847950
No idea. 847950-848390
All right, I'll be honest, Mumbo. 848390-850630
I don't think we're cracking at the top score, and it's gonna be a big controversy. 850630-855230
No, you. 855390-855870
Do you make your eyes. 855870-856910
Baked potato. 857790-858790
Have you got a potato? 858790-859670
Oh, I do have potatoes. 859670-860670
I just threw them on the ground. 860670-861630
Let's bring that through. 861710-862590
Okay. 865800-866080
I've got seven beetroot seeds. 866080-867720
Am I allowed to store those, or is that kind of not. 867720-869920
I think you can throw them on the floor. 869920-871480
Yeah. 871480-872040
So a baked potato here as well. 873640-875200
So if you bring the potatoes through because they need to cook. 875200-877160
Okay, I've got seven potatoes. 878280-880040
Melon slice. 880920-881880
Okay. 882680-883240
I wonder if I can. 883480-884200
Potato first. 884200-884720
Potato first. 884720-885280
I wonder if I can time it. 885280-886440
I can't pick it up. 889170-890050
Oh, my goodness. 890610-891490
It's really important that we. 894690-896850
Yes. 896850-897330
See? 897410-897690
I got through. 897690-898050
I made it through. 898050-899010
What do you mean you made it through? 900930-902090
Right, Melon slice. 902090-903170
Yeah, look, we're crushing it. 903730-906010
We're crushing it. 906010-906770
There's a baked potato on the way. 907090-908290
Ren's here. 908290-909010
Carrot. 913410-914050
Okay. 914330-914530
He needs carrot. 914530-915450
Carrot. 915530-916010
Okay, good. 916010-916650
I have a carrot ready. 916730-918490
Oh, we didn't. 919290-919930
We didn't place the item frames right. 919930-921170
I'm gonna throw out the melon slices. 921170-922490
The phone's going. 923210-924170
This is the Krusty Krab. 924250-925450
This is the Krusty Krab. 926890-928410
I've answered the phone. 928650-929770
Carrot and baked potatoes. 930650-931810
The baked potato Done. 931810-932530
It must be. 932530-933050
Yes. 933290-933770
Carrot, carrot, carrot, Done. 935770-937530
Okay, I need. 937610-939490
I was getting really angry. 939490-940770
I can't. 940770-941130
I can't, I can't. 941130-942010
Okay, there's the fish. 942160-943040
Why can't you get a baked potato? 944560-946320
I've got it. 946320-946920
I've got it. 946920-947320
Right. 947320-947520
Do you need to eat anything? 947520-948560
Yeah, I've just eaten that fish. 949360-950800
Okay. 950800-951360
I actually am gonna just eat stuff. 951760-953240
There's a problem. 953240-953840
Yeah. 954400-954880
Right. 954880-955200
Beef, beef, beef. 955920-956880
Last one hopefully wants, like, melons or something. 956880-961440
Melon. 962240-962800
Yes. 962880-963360
Nice. 963440-964000
Ah, he's been served faster than he even knew what to do. 964720-968080
Okay. 969920-970360
All right, I'm gonna put these baked potatoes on. 970360-973760
I think we did it. 975280-976240
I think we smashed that. 977360-978480
Nice. 978480-978840
I'm gonna just. 978840-979440
I'm gonna do a little bit cleaning. 979440-980600
Melon slice is not something great to store here. 980600-983280
No, no, you are right. 983840-985080
We should probably just throw it on the ground. 985080-986480
Oh, the rats. 987440-988400
How does. 988720-989320
How does the game know when there's stuff on the floor? 989320-991520
It is difficult. 992160-993040
Okay. 994330-994690
Yes. 994690-995130
This is a good idea, actually. 995130-996650
Having these. 996650-997290
Having these three Having like the selection. 997370-1000490
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 1000810-1003090
Good plan. 1003090-1003530
Still think, like, I still think having a bucket of water there is probably one of the most time consuming. 1003530-1008410
Yeah. 1009689-1010169
If you need to get a fresh bucket, that's order a bucket. 1010330-1012930
So you need that in the item frame. 1012930-1014650
Yeah, that is true. 1014650-1015490
That is true. 1015490-1016170
What? 1016810-1017210
Extra hot bar slot. 1017530-1018890
Yes. 1018890-1019370
Okay. 1019450-1019890
Okay. 1019890-1020210
Except that one. 1020210-1020970
Nice. 1021370-1021810
Right. 1021810-1022170
Okay. 1022900-1023180
We're in a good place. 1023180-1024580
So what's. 1024820-1025340
What's the deal with food? 1025340-1026180
Like when you take it in here? 1026180-1027620
Yeah, I mean, I'm assuming. 1028180-1029540
I'm assuming you can't just go out the door. 1029700-1031620
No, no, but I mean, like, if we take a baked potato in here, can we eat up? 1032100-1035140
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 1035380-1036580
Right, ready? 1037140-1038020
Day two. 1039620-1040260
Let's do it. 1040260-1041060
Right. 1041460-1041820
What is the strat? 1041820-1042780
What is the strat? 1042780-1043580
This time I might go and get that bucket of water. 1043580-1046220
I just sense it, you know? 1046220-1047500
Yeah, yeah. 1047500-1048140
Okay. 1048140-1048460
I'm gonna throw some trash away. 1048460-1049540
Is there anything that I can cook? 1053130-1054490
I reckon no. 1054490-1055370
Freezer. 1055450-1055930
A freezer run is a good idea. 1055930-1057250
Do you want to go freezer run? 1057250-1058170
Where did the fuck it go? 1058170-1059050
Okay, I'll go for a freezer. 1060090-1061290
Yeah, I'm on it. 1062970-1063610
I'm on it. 1063610-1064170
Nice. 1065370-1065770
That is such a good sound. 1065770-1066970
Okay. 1069930-1070450
Does that. 1070450-1070930
Wait, I think that pressure plate instant opens the door. 1070930-1073370
Ready? 1074010-1074570
There's an. 1074570-1075130
Yeah. 1075130-1075530
What? 1078160-1078360
This one? 1078360-1078880
I think so. 1080240-1081040
That seems weird. 1082720-1083840
Pressure plate and I think the door instantly opens. 1083840-1085960
Oh, it does. 1085960-1086560
That's so that you can let me out quicker. 1087600-1089600
Oh, I can let you out. 1089680-1091200
That's actually really useful. 1091360-1093360
It's very useful. 1094000-1095120
Right. 1095120-1095360
And I'm gonna take the minecart back. 1095360-1096680
So we have that. 1096680-1097320

Dude, you're crushing it. 1460940-1462620
I got the chicken already. 1462620-1463620
Preemptive chicken. 1464500-1465860
Nice. 1466020-1466500
All right, who else have we got? 1467540-1469500
Cleo's on her way in. 1469500-1470580
This is. 1471220-1471740
This. 1471740-1472100
This. 1472180-1472500
I feel like we need to be proactive in the. 1472500-1474380
In the garden over there. 1474380-1475340
Yeah. 1475340-1475620
Well, I've got bone meal, so I could go. 1475620-1477220
Yeah, just go and farm a bunch of beetroot or something. 1477730-1480130
Yeah, I'll see what Cleo wants. 1480130-1482130
Cook chicken again. 1485650-1486490
Oh, no, Mumbo. 1486490-1487570
There's chicken. 1490050-1491010
Chicken. 1491650-1492290
I'm going for the chicken. 1493090-1494290
Okay, I'm waiting. 1494290-1500850
Yes. 1501170-1501530
Did you get the chicken? 1501530-1502450
Yeah, first time. 1502770-1503930
Nailed it. 1503930-1504410
Please let me out. 1504410-1505010
I'm trying. 1505010-1505570
I'm waiting for the door. 1505570-1506770
It's so cold. 1511250-1512530
Okay, right. 1514770-1515650
Cook one cooked chicken. 1516370-1517530
1. 1517530-1517770
One on the fire. 1517770-1518570
There we go. 1518570-1519170
Right, Tango was first. 1519170-1520450
Melon slice. 1520850-1521570
Okay, Slice. 1521570-1522450
There was one on w. 1522610-1523610
Wait, did I eat it? 1523610-1524370
No, no. 1524370-1524770
I think it's in the. 1524770-1525490
Yeah, you ate it. 1525490-1526530
I saw you. 1526530-1527250
I saw you eat it. 1527410-1528450
I threw it. 1528450-1528930
Right. 1528930-1529130
Let me through, let me through, let me through. 1529130-1530450
Okay. 1534960-1535240
There's a lot of things that we've left on the ground. 1535240-1537280
I was thinking the minecart would have been quicker for the melon slice. 1538720-1541280
Yes. 1541600-1542160
I forget. 1542240-1543120
Oh, there's rubbish. 1543760-1544880
Okay. 1546000-1546479
Don't want rats. 1546479-1547280
I think the rats come regardless. 1548640-1550560
But I think. 1550560-1551280
No, no, no. 1551280-1551960
They only. 1551960-1552400
They only if you leave stuff on the floor that. 1552400-1554400
How does that work? 1554960-1555920
I. 1557210-1557410
I guess it's all. 1557410-1558250
Okay. 1559770-1560330
I guess it's all skulk stuff. 1560730-1562490
That actually makes a lot of sense. 1563450-1564810
Right. 1564970-1565330
All right. 1565330-1565690
Last. 1565690-1565970
Last one, maybe. 1565970-1566690
Maybe. 1566690-1567050
No, we got the other people coming in. 1567050-1568650
Cooked pork chop. 1570570-1571770
Oh, gosh. 1571770-1572810
I'm going into the freezer. 1573930-1576090
Is the minecart there? 1578970-1580170
I've got the knack of it, though. 1581050-1582490
Okay. 1582970-1583370
I'm going through. 1583370-1583970
Into the farm to pick up. 1583970-1585130
To pick up all the items so that they don't despawn. 1585130-1587690
Yep, yep. 1588730-1590410
Yeah. 1590570-1591050
What like now? 1591050-1591850
Now I'm in the freezer. 1592090-1596170
Are you coming out of the freezer? 1596330-1597930
Are you coming out of the freezer? 1598090-1599690
I am by the door. 1599690-1601050
You have to tell me when you're doing this stuff. 1603850-1605690
Like I said I was going to get the pork chop. 1605690-1608170
I didn't think it was at that exact moment. 1608810-1611580
Someone's got to get. 1612940-1613780
The meat's like a long. 1613780-1614660
Okay, there's a carrot. 1614660-1615460
There's a carrot. 1615460-1616140
Carrot, carrot. 1616140-1617100
And we got a carrot in the item frame and be. 1617100-1619580
I'll do that. 1619660-1620140
Oh, there's a rat. 1620140-1620940
Oh, great. 1621580-1622220
I might die. 1623020-1623620
The rat. 1623620-1624220
Dude, if you die. 1624780-1625980
I didn't hit that once. 1627980-1629180
Yeah, I think. 1629260-1629820
Well, there's. 1629820-1630260
There's a baked potato here if you. 1630260-1631340
If you need it. 1631340-1632060
Yeah, I Probably will. 1632620-1633660
Right, I'm going to go back through and I'm going to start baking up some potatoes. 1634380-1637100
Baked potatoes. 1637100-1637900
We need a beetroot. 1638350-1639230
I can handle the pork chop. 1639230-1640550
Okay. 1640550-1640830
I've got. 1640830-1641150

Yep, got a beetroot. 1648030-1649230
Okay. 1651550-1651990
Running through. 1651990-1652470

All right. 1653630-1654190
I think that's. 1654590-1655390
That might be it. 1655470-1656190
No, no, we're fine. 1656190-1656750
We're fine. 1656750-1657030
There we go. 1657030-1657390
We got a cooked pork chip chop. 1657390-1658910
Oh, there's actually customers outside. 1659070-1660670
Cooked chicken mumbo. 1660990-1662990
I am going in the freezer. 1662990-1664190
Yeah, I'm familiar with how these things work. 1666910-1668430
The cooked chicken is actually a problem. 1668830-1670750
Yeah. 1671230-1671670
Oh, gosh, the phone's ringing. 1671670-1673230
Yep, got it. 1674030-1674830
Yeah. 1674910-1675470
Have you got the. 1675630-1676310
Have you got the chicken? 1676310-1677070
Yeah, I am here, but I'm making my way. 1677070-1679710
I'm. 1682510-1682990
I'm running low on food as well. 1683150-1684870
I think I might. 1684870-1685510
Okay, Joy, I'll get you. 1685510-1688670
You sort yourself out. 1688670-1689550
I'll just take my own order for a second. 1689550-1691310
What do you want? 1691570-1692210
Okay, I'm going to go across. 1692290-1693890
I got bone meal, melon slice. 1693890-1696770
That's easy. 1696770-1697210
I'll handle that. 1697210-1697770
You just focus on getting yourself some food. 1697770-1699410
Yes, I've got loads of that. 1702770-1704170
That's good. 1704170-1704770
Let's. 1706290-1706850
Let's load up the campfire with some potatoes as well. 1706850-1709250
Yep. 1710690-1711250
You got melon slice. 1712130-1713090
Did you? 1713090-1713370
We. 1713370-1713610
We almost. 1713610-1714130
We almost lost our last potato. 1715010-1717090
Oh. 1718550-1718870
Cuz remember, we need to make sure we actually keep. 1719190-1721830
You know, I'm gonna put a potato in the thing because otherwise. 1721830-1726070
Yeah, that's a good idea. 1726470-1727670
That was the advice that we got, right? 1728550-1730150
Yeah. 1730150-1730550
I've got 13 potatoes. 1730550-1732110
I don't even know if that's. 1732110-1733190
Dude, the. 1734390-1735070
The melon. 1735070-1736230
Melon sliced guy needs food. 1736710-1738310
Oh. 1738390-1738790
Oh. 1738790-1739190
The cooked chicken should be done as well. 1739190-1740870
Nice. 1740950-1741390
Let me out. 1741390-1741870
Let me out. 1741870-1742270
Let me out. 1742270-1742670
Let me out. 1742670-1743070
Let me out. 1743070-1743530
Let me out. 1743530-1743930
Let me. 1743930-1744210
I'm also in this queue. 1744210-1745290
This is painful. 1745290-1746050
Okay. 1747250-1747730
Cooked chicken's a problem. 1747730-1748690
It's there. 1749330-1749890
I've got it. 1749890-1750290
I've got it, got it, got it. 1750290-1751010
Good. 1751010-1751250
Cooked chicken. 1751970-1752770
You take. 1752770-1753650
Done. 1753730-1754130
Are we allowed to store more potatoes? 1754130-1756050
Done. 1756050-1756450
God. 1759409-1759890
Rubbish. 1759970-1760410
What do you want, Skizz? 1760410-1761410
Probably something really annoying quite quickly. 1761890-1764850
Peat root. 1764850-1765570
Oh, I don't think we've got any of that stuff we got. 1766050-1769370
We got rubbish as well. 1769370-1770530
I really need these baked potatoes to hurry up. 1773410-1775490
I'm running so low on food. 1775890-1777490
Beetroot. 1777650-1778250
I mean, eat these Melon slices here. 1778250-1779810
I'll go and get the beetroot. 1780450-1781730
Oh, all the potatoes are done. 1782370-1783730
All the potatoes are done. 1783730-1784770
Okay, well, eat up. 1785170-1786610
Oh, no. 1789890-1790530
What's up? 1791330-1791970
Just that you dropped a baked potato on the floor here. 1793650-1796930
Yeah, I don't have any inventory stuff. 1797490-1799810
Some stuff despawn. 1800310-1801270
Yeah, I mean, that's gonna happen, right? 1802870-1804230
Because that is like, literally our storage system, in a way. 1804230-1806870
Like throwing stuff on the floor. 1806870-1808070
We're not allowed to store things in a chest, are we? 1808230-1810710
No. 1811590-1811990
Oh, gosh. 1812950-1813750
Oh, Skizz is looking at the floor. 1813910-1815710
Have you got beetroot? 1815710-1816750
Yeah. 1816750-1817070
Yeah. 1817070-1817430
Let me out. 1817430-1817830
Let me out. 1817830-1818070
Let me out. 1818070-1818350
Let me out. 1818350-1818870
Go on. 1820550-1821190
Go running. 1821590-1822630
I'm running. 1822790-1823590
Take it. 1824710-1825190
Go. 1825190-1825510
He might be our last customer, mate. 1826030-1829550
Have we broken through? 1830590-1831790
I think we. 1832350-1832990
I think we're. 1832990-1833510
I think we're flying. 1833510-1834430
Yes, Grian. 1837630-1838670
Yes. 1838750-1839310
Yes, Grian. 1840030-1841070
What are we on? 1842590-1843390
Is this. 1843390-1843750
Are we on to day four? 1843750-1844830
Are we allowed. 1845150-1845870
Are we able to check our store? 1845870-1847230
Are we allowed to celebrate? 1847710-1848910
I mean, I think so. 1848910-1849750
Maybe a potato party. 1849750-1850790
Little potato party. 1850790-1851710
Press this to lock the offered daily upgrade. 1852480-1854720
Oh, speedy service. 1856480-1860120
You get to move around faster. 1860120-1861440
Well, that's gotta be good. 1863040-1864680
That's gotta be good, right? 1864680-1865760
Yeah, that's just a general upgrade. 1866560-1869920
Yeah. 1869920-1870400
Right. 1870400-1870800
I'm feeling fresh. 1871680-1872720
Do we have any change of plan or are we just gonna keep. 1872800-1875360
No, I think. 1875600-1876520
I think we're flying at the moment. 1876520-1878000
Just communication, baby. 1878000-1880010
This is very helpful. 1880010-1881170
Okay. 1881810-1882290
Yeah, this is. 1882290-1882850
This is very good. 1882850-1883810
Right. 1884210-1884530
Let's be proactive. 1884530-1885490
I'm gonna go get some meat. 1885490-1886610
Yes. 1886850-1887330
Yep. 1887570-1888090
And I am going to. 1888090-1889890
What should I do? 1891250-1892130
Should I go to the farm or should I not go to the farm? 1892290-1896930
I'm gonna try and grab another bit of meat. 1897090-1899010
I'm gonna go for the cooked chicken. 1899010-1900290
I missed. 1901090-1901810
How did that miss? 1903330-1904210
Yes. 1906540-1906860
Nice, nice, nice, nice. 1906860-1908140
All right, I got two bits of meat. 1908140-1909500
Hopefully they want a chicken or a cod. 1909500-1911100
Are you able to get. 1911660-1912580
Are you able to move in here faster? 1912580-1914100
Is this. 1914100-1914620
It might. 1915500-1916060
Doesn't feel like it. 1916300-1917340
Okay. 1917580-1918140
I feel. 1918460-1918940
I feel like I'm being totally useless right now. 1918940-1920700
I've got bone meal, so I might as well go into the farm. 1920700-1922860
I'll take cubs. 1923100-1923900
Order cub. 1923900-1925100
What do you want? 1925100-1925660
He wants baked potato, which I have in my hand. 1926300-1929940
So we're good? 1929940-1930500
Yes. 1930500-1930940
Nice. 1931190-1931390
Okay. 1931390-1931710
A lot of our stuff in the farm is despawned. 1931710-1933630
That is. 1933630-1934150
No, no problem. 1934310-1935350
Oh, do you need dog treats? 1937350-1938630
I have some bone meal. 1939830-1940990
There should. 1940990-1941390
There should be some by the dog. 1941390-1942630
I think we need to Keep farming. 1942630-1943990
I probably should leave these things, actually. 1948870-1951430
Like, I probably should leave them. 1951430-1953430
Melon slice. 1955270-1956230
Melon slice. 1957020-1957500
Okay, I'll get that one here in the item frame. 1957500-1959460
Nice, nice. 1959460-1960060
I'll get one to replace it. 1960060-1961220
I feel like that's also probably important. 1961220-1962860
Wait, I've got 15 melon slices in my hand. 1967020-1969260
That's fine. 1971180-1971900
Hey, could you possibly. 1972300-1975180
Yeah, just keep farming. 1975180-1976220
Beetroot, I think. 1976220-1977020
Yeah, I've got some beetroot here. 1977020-1978620
Carrot. 1978620-1979260
She wants carrot. 1979340-1980380
If you at any point find. 1981260-1983350
Oh, carrot. 1984150-1985110
Okay. 1985270-1985830
Oh, no. 1987510-1988510
Is there a carrot out there? 1988510-1989910
This might be a carrot here. 1990790-1991990
Oh, please tell me we didn't throw away or. 1992070-1993990
It didn't despawn, did it? 1993990-1995350
I think we might have lost. 1996070-1997190
There's a good. 1999270-1999830
There's a really good chance that. 1999830-2000990
That's not a carrot. 2000990-2001590
That's a beetroot. 2001590-2002390
That's a beetroot. 2002790-2003750
We grian. 2005830-2007510
Can we take the one out the item frame? 2007990-2009510
How did that slip. 2012960-2013720
I despawned, didn't it? 2013720-2014920
Yeah, I think we were faffing right, that. 2014920-2017840
No, we're just not. 2018640-2019520
We're not. 2019520-2019880
We're not, like, trained in the game. 2019880-2021280
I reckon at the end of every round, people must, like, go and refresh their timer, maybe. 2021280-2026640
Yeah, well, that's the thing, right? 2027440-2029120
That's what I was trying to do. 2029120-2030000
I was, like, running in there and I was, like, throwing the items out onto the ground and things. 2030000-2034080
But then as. 2034080-2034800
But then you got stuck in the freezer, right? 2035130-2037370
Well, I guess. 2037370-2037930
Okay, we can. 2037930-2038530
We can get more points. 2038530-2039330
There's ways that we can get more points still. 2039330-2041050
I feel like we shouldn't give up. 2041050-2043130
We. 2044490-2044850
Look. 2044850-2045130
Water bottle. 2045130-2045810
That's easy. 2045810-2046530
Easy points there. 2046530-2047530
So we can just get. 2047530-2048330
Water bottle. 2048330-2049010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 2049010-2049890
We might as well. 2049890-2050490
We might as well maximize the number of points given that this is actually, for us, a pretty good run. 2050490-2055130
This is a pretty good run. 2055530-2056650
What's up? 2057210-2057730
What's the name of our restaurant? 2057730-2058970
I mean, there's gotta be it. 2062399-2064919
We've gotta think of a play on words for Krusty Krab for us. 2064919-2068159
Well, I was thinking, what's. 2068879-2070479
What's the. 2070799-2071519
The food hygiene thing called? 2071519-2073279
What, the stars? 2073439-2074399
Yeah, I was just gonna say we're. 2075599-2077038
We're number one or something. 2077119-2078399
Yeah, One star. 2078879-2079759
We're one. 2081919-2082519
We're one. 2082519-2083199
We're number one on the food hygiene races. 2083359-2085959
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2085959-2086559
We got first place. 2086559-2087470
Oh, nicely done. 2089790-2090750
Nicely done. 2090750-2091430
I think. 2091430-2091830
Yeah, that's not too bad. 2091830-2092750
So we can chuck everything here. 2092750-2094350
Put it all in the bin. 2094350-2095550
Yeah. 2095710-2096230
Hey, not too bad. 2096230-2097950
Yeah. 2098110-2098590
Too bad, right? 2098750-2100510
Is there anything that we can do to make our lives like this Cauldron is empty. 2100990-2104350
Normally it's filled. 2104350-2105470
Should we. 2105630-2106150
I think we need to reset because I think. 2106150-2107830
Yeah. 2107830-2108030
The minecart's in the wrong place. 2108030-2109310
Yeah. 2109470-2109910
And the carrot will spawn. 2109910-2111070
So, I mean, we have to leave that. 2111070-2112270
I'll at least get a minecart back where it's supposed to be. 2113320-2115840
Yeah. 2115840-2116120
Yeah. 2116120-2116320
That seems. 2116320-2116800
These. 2116800-2117000
Seems. 2117000-2117480
These seem fair. 2117480-2118360
And we'll need to put our slot back. 2119640-2121400
All right, let's. 2121400-2122200
Let's go again. 2122200-2123000
Okay. 2123720-2124280
What was our score? 2125240-2126280
Yeah. 2126680-2127040
No. 2127040-2127240
So this is what we have to look at. 2127240-2128440
Let me. 2128840-2129320
Let me have a look. 2129320-2130120
So keep it in mind that the high score is 300 and something. 2131320-2134440
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. 2135160-2136760
We probably got like, what? 2136760-2138200
280. 2138820-2139300
We're probably pretty close. 2139300-2140500
Pretty close. 2140740-2141300
Pretty close. 2141300-2141860
60 is not bad, I think. 2145700-2147700
How do people get scores that high? 2148900-2150660
I guess I get. 2150660-2151700
They're just kinda like a system and a rhythm and they're like. 2151700-2154780
They don't miss beats. 2154780-2155500
I mean, we. 2155500-2155980
We actually only lost that because our carrot despawned. 2155980-2158780
And that's just like a learning curve thing. 2158780-2160300
Surely, like, we just didn't. 2160300-2161780
We didn't keep a carrot in that box. 2161780-2163620
Yeah, we need to keep the carrot. 2163620-2165060
So the. 2165140-2165580
Keeping the carrot and the potato in the box is very important. 2165580-2168180
That is something that we need to. 2168340-2169620
Sure. 2170480-2170560
That we stay on top of. 2170560-2171760
All right, try again. 2172240-2173360
Yeah, I'm ready. 2173520-2175520
I'm excited and concerned. 2175680-2178960
I don't know why I suddenly get nervous as soon as we go in here. 2179280-2181800
Have you got all your slots sorted? 2181800-2183280
Yeah, I think so. 2183280-2184160
Cool. 2184160-2184640
Alrighty, let's go. 2186400-2187520
Straight in the fridge for me. 2187520-2188720
Okay. 2188720-2189120
So you're going in the fridge. 2189120-2190120
I go get dog treats. 2190120-2191480
This is the way that we kind of play the game currently. 2191480-2193440
Yeah. 2193600-2194160
Gonna get a code. 2194800-2195900
Yeah. 2197570-2197810
Early game cod. 2197810-2198850
I'm gonna also get a pork chop. 2199650-2201810
Oh, no, I didn't. 2202850-2203570
Wait. 2203570-2203970
Ah, that's silly. 2203970-2205050
Stupid, even. 2205050-2205970
What have you done? 2207010-2207730
Oh, no. 2207730-2208290
Yeah, no. 2208290-2209090
Okay, one more. 2209250-2209930
One more try. 2209930-2210370
One more try. 2210370-2210930
Are you gonna die within the first few minutes? 2212930-2214690
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2214690-2216290
Are you okay? 2218770-2219650
No, I'm just gonna need some heavy baked potato help later. 2219970-2223010
This is the sacrifice, right? 2223850-2225770
Yeah. 2226410-2226850
But if we have these meats ready to go, they're so time consuming. 2226850-2230090
Yeah, yeah. 2230090-2230890
All right. 2231210-2231770
So rotten flesh. 2232010-2233130
I'll just order a few more rotten flesh. 2233210-2234890
I'm just gonna keep ordering rotten flesh. 2236010-2237690
So we should just keep a pile of it next to the Dog. 2237690-2240170
Yes. 2240650-2241130
That's a good idea. 2241130-2242090
Right, we'll tell you what, I'm gonna order a bucket as well and get that ready. 2242570-2245610
We got our first order. 2247770-2248890
Carrot. 2250600-2251040
Carrot. 2251040-2251560
Mumbo. 2251560-2252080
Carrot. 2252080-2252600
Okay. 2252600-2252920
That's the one thing that we don't have any of, so that's ideal. 2252920-2256120
Well, I'm gonna come through and do a few bits. 2257080-2259160
Here we are. 2259160-2262880
Hungy Hermes. 2262880-2263880
Okay, I have got five carrots. 2264040-2266680
Okay. 2267080-2267640
Let's put this straight back in. 2268440-2270040
Okay. 2270600-2271040
There is a carrot in there. 2271040-2272280
I'm gonna farm some potatoes for our own personal consumption. 2276840-2280200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 2280200-2281120
Okay. 2281120-2281320
We got another customer as well. 2281320-2282400
Hopefully they want carrots too. 2282400-2283640
That would make my life. 2283640-2284520
Grian, you're here as well. 2284760-2286200
You're probably gonna want something annoying. 2286520-2288120
You're probably gonna want, like, beef bourguignon. 2291800-2293560
Oh, no. 2293560-2293840
You want carrot. 2293840-2294680
Oh, sweet. 2295640-2296520
Well, that's good. 2296840-2297560
Nice. 2297560-2298040
Lots of carrots. 2298200-2299160
Okay. 2300600-2301040
Beetroot. 2301040-2301520
Beetroot. 2301520-2301960
There's one on the floor. 2301960-2302760
I got one. 2302760-2303360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2303360-2303880
We're good. 2303880-2304280
And getting rid of rubbish. 2305010-2311570
Cool. 2311970-2312330
The rubbish situation is frustrating. 2312330-2314050
Yeah. 2314770-2315250
Need those extra slots. 2315650-2316890
Right. 2316890-2317250
So someone wants beetroot. 2317250-2318690
Yep. 2318770-2319330
And. 2320850-2321249
Oh, did you already take care of the carrot? 2321810-2323410
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2323410-2324130
That was you. 2324130-2324610
I'll get it. 2325570-2325970
I'll get it. 2325970-2326370
I'll get it. 2326370-2327010
Beetroot again. 2327250-2328130
Is there anything that we need to do when it comes to. 2329170-2331330
Yeah, I can. 2331590-2331950
I can let you through. 2331950-2332630
Oh, thank you. 2332790-2333670
I have another beetroot ready, so that's pretty good. 2334470-2336470
Okay. 2336870-2337430
Gem is here. 2337830-2338710
Gem also wants carrots. 2341750-2343630
Okay. 2343630-2344110
Oh, I've left carrots in the thing. 2344110-2345350
This is actually great. 2345350-2346470
Okay. 2349750-2350470
Oh, the cauldron was empty, so that's good. 2351670-2353510
I've just filled that up. 2354550-2355790
Nice. 2355790-2356150
Beetroot done. 2356150-2357590
Have we crushed day one? 2358070-2359510
Yeah, I think so. 2359750-2360710
Stop leaving the minecart on the other side, though. 2361910-2363830
Yeah, we do definitely need to do that. 2363910-2365270
We also. 2365270-2365630
Do you have, like, a personal supply of potatoes yet? 2365630-2368150
Not yet. 2368630-2369230
I didn't manage to get to that. 2369230-2370550
I think we're done for the day. 2370790-2371830
Yeah, we have. 2371830-2372470
But how smooth was that first day? 2372470-2374790
That was pretty smooth. 2375670-2376870
Like, it was pretty good compared to previous ones. 2377910-2380710
Yeah, that was. 2381350-2382070
That was, like, pretty faultless. 2382070-2383830
Yeah. 2384150-2384630
Did you put the. 2384630-2385430
Did the cooked meat despawn or be holding it? 2386040-2388280
I have no. 2388600-2389400
No cooked meat. 2389480-2390520
Did we use it? 2392040-2393000
Why is there two rotten flesh in the item frame and not the precious cooked meat? 2395400-2401160
I was rushing. 2401640-2402680
We need to be quick, otherwise, stuff's gonna despawn. 2403960-2405920
Okay. 2405920-2406160
Yeah, yeah. 2406160-2406680
Okay. 2408040-2408520
So the cooked meat endeavor at the start was Pointless because I think it despawned. 2408520-2412040
We've got a bun. 2413180-2414180
We've got extra item frames. 2414180-2415420
Is that useful? 2415420-2416060
I think that's useful. 2416060-2416940
Not massively, I don't think. 2419820-2421060
Or do we do reject. 2421060-2422020
It is. 2422020-2422860
Let's just take it. 2422940-2423820
Yeah. 2423820-2424220
Let's just roll it through. 2424620-2425380
We're still new at the game. 2425380-2426340
Yeah. 2426340-2426860
We'll find out what's good and what's not. 2427340-2428980
Yeah. 2428980-2429300
Alright. 2429300-2429580
Let's get stuff. 2429580-2430500
Not despawning. 2430500-2431340
Yeah. 2431420-2431860
I'm not gonna go into the freezer until we. 2431860-2433980
I've got the supply of potatoes under control. 2433980-2436940
Oh, my goodness. 2437100-2437780
We have loads of item frames. 2437780-2439100
This is actually. 2439100-2439660
Yeah, super useful. 2439660-2440700
Yeah. 2441360-2441600
We'll just pile on loads of stuff then. 2441600-2443360
Yeah. 2443360-2443920
I've got like beetroot seeds and stuff. 2444480-2446120
Do you need any bone meal? 2446120-2447200
Yes, I will. 2447920-2448720
Okay. 2448880-2449440
Oh, I can run through. 2451520-2452560
No. 2452560-2452880
Oh, we got flood. 2456880-2458240
Let me out. 2458240-2458680
Let me out first. 2458680-2459160
Let me out first. 2459160-2459840
That's actually such a good idea. 2460320-2461760
Okay, I'll go. 2462720-2463400
Okay. 2463400-2464640
I got it. 2465520-2466240
Okay. 2467780-2468180
Nice smooth, smooth maneuvers from the team. 2469620-2472420
Any orders? 2472500-2473300
Nope. 2473380-2473740
But I've got dog treats. 2473740-2474820
I've got dog treats. 2474900-2475980
I. 2475980-2476340
I'll be honest. 2476420-2477140
I'm pretty desperate up for food at the moment. 2477140-2478980
Yeah. 2478980-2479460
Unable. 2479460-2480020
I've been unable to farm anything. 2480260-2482020
Yeah. 2482260-2482740
Yeah. 2483220-2483540
That is a bit of a rough go. 2483540-2484660
Oh, we've got a customer. 2484740-2486100
Tato. 2486100-2486740
I really want. 2487780-2489020
I think the extra slots are the most important thing you could have. 2489020-2492260
It's cooked chicken, dude. 2493310-2494590
Okay, that's fine. 2495150-2496270
I'm gonna get all these potatoes cooking. 2499470-2501390
Yep. 2501710-2502270
Right. 2504110-2504510
I'm gonna. 2504830-2505350
I'm gonna go for the cooked chicken. 2505350-2506430
But it is gonna be a quick in and out job because. 2506430-2508190
Yep. 2508350-2508910
I'm pretty low on hunger. 2509230-2510910
Yep. 2510990-2511550
But it's a. 2511950-2513510
It's a learning curve to know where to throw the snowball. 2513510-2516230
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2516230-2517150
So you want to aim for like the third block up. 2518120-2520680
Yeah. 2520920-2521480
Baked potato. 2521480-2522160
Baked potato from. 2522160-2522880
From BDubs. 2522880-2523520
This is actually really useful. 2523520-2524400
That's already on. 2524400-2524960
That's already on. 2524960-2525480
Yeah. 2525480-2525880
Good. 2531320-2531720
Cool. 2532040-2532400
There's kind of no way to not take damage in that freezer. 2532400-2534600
Right. 2534600-2534760
Like that is. 2534760-2535360
No, there is. 2535360-2535880
You always take damage, which is why you need to. 2535880-2537960
Nice. 2538360-2538760
Always have a bit of food on yourself. 2538760-2540200
Cool. 2540760-2541240
Give some to. 2541240-2542200
To BDubs. 2542280-2543240
Yeah. 2544050-2544290
One Speedubs. 2544290-2545370
And that brings me back up to full. 2545370-2547250
I'll take Hypnos. 2547490-2548610
Order. 2548770-2549170
Please. 2549650-2549930
Don't say baked potato. 2549930-2550970
I just ate them in front of you. 2550970-2552210
Melon slice. 2553410-2554170
Okay. 2554170-2554370
That's easy. 2554370-2554850
Yeah, that's easy. 2554850-2555970
I do have some beetroot seeds. 2556610-2558090
Do we need those, or should I just. 2558090-2559210
No, in fact, yeah, we never need to store beetroot seeds. 2559210-2562490
That's such a good point. 2562490-2563570
Put them. 2563650-2564090
Put them in that. 2564090-2564570
Don't throw them on the floor, though. 2564570-2565450
Otherwise you get the rats. 2565450-2566370
Yeah. 2566370-2566850
Who. 2567570-2567890
Who's. 2567890-2568250
Who's upset? 2568250-2568930
The cooked chicken must be done by now. 2569020-2570380
The cooked chicken. 2570380-2571260
Oh, flood. 2572060-2572940
Yes. 2573500-2573900
Cook chicken. 2573900-2574580
Okay, I'm. 2574580-2575140
I'm giving it to impulse. 2575140-2576380
All right. 2576460-2576820
I'm. 2576820-2577140
I'm coming into minecart, so if you go to the. 2577140-2580300
Go to the flood thing, I'm ready. 2580300-2581780
Yep, I'm here. 2581780-2583420
Wait, did you do it? 2585580-2587420
Wait, are you coming? 2587580-2588420
I'm here. 2588420-2588780
I'm here. 2588780-2589060
I'm. 2589060-2589420
I'm here. 2589660-2590220
No. 2591580-2591980
What? 2592220-2592580
The door was open. 2592580-2593500
Good job, dude. 2594220-2595180
I don't understand what happened there. 2596170-2598050
I don't understand what happened there either. 2598050-2599690
The door wasn't open. 2599690-2600570
You didn't go in. 2600890-2601850
No, I don't think the door was open the whole time. 2602810-2605210
Right. 2605210-2605530
There's a melon slice that needs to be. 2605530-2607210
That needs to be done. 2607450-2608490
I feel like we're falling apart, Grian. 2608730-2610570
We're falling apart. 2610810-2612010
We need beetroot. 2612010-2613130
Beetroot on it. 2613770-2614890
And there's a melon slice as well. 2616890-2618370
Scars here as well. 2618370-2619290
He's probably gonna be complaining. 2619290-2620450
Scarlet, you best want something simple, mate. 2620450-2623250
He wants a water bottle. 2624530-2625810
He wants a water bottle. 2625810-2627090
I can't get through the door because of the flood. 2628370-2630370
The melon slice. 2631090-2631970
Melon slice is upset. 2631970-2633010
Okay? 2633490-2633930
That's the communication I needed. 2633930-2635250
Leave me alone. 2638530-2639290
I'm trying my best. 2639290-2640290
I didn't know who was upset. 2641010-2642530
Yeah, melon slice. 2642930-2643850
Melon slice. 2643850-2644610
Oh, no. 2645490-2646250
Well, I'm on it. 2646250-2647010
Trying to get into the. 2647960-2648920
Oh, come on. 2649000-2649840
Hurry up. 2649840-2650160
Hurry up. 2650160-2650600
All right. 2651320-2651880
He's okay. 2652120-2653000
He's happy. 2653080-2653880
Yeah, I got. 2653880-2654560
I got the water bottle. 2654560-2655480
Got his beetroot. 2655480-2656440
Oh, nice. 2656680-2657280
We've done. 2657280-2657880
There we go. 2657880-2658520
Oh, there's a kitchen. 2658600-2659400
And the kitchen's not flooded anymore. 2659400-2660880
Yeah, right. 2660880-2661480
It's all coming up. 2661800-2662760
Wait, what did we just lose? 2663640-2664920
Why did we lose. 2666520-2667480
What? 2667960-2668360
Why did we lose? 2670920-2671800
Were the people waiting outside out there for too long? 2671800-2674120
I don't know. 2674540-2675660
I think. 2676540-2677020
I think we left them outside for too long. 2677020-2678780
I think that affects your representation, like your reputation. 2678780-2681260
Right? 2681340-2681660
Is it time that we switch over to your episodes? 2681660-2683820
Yeah. 2684140-2684700
Okay. 2685260-2685900
Well, we smashed it. 2686540-2688300
We smashed it briefly and then didn't smash it. 2689100-2691300
We unsmashed it. 2691300-2692300
We're basically ready to run a real restaurant. 2692380-2695820
Yeah. 2695820-2696300
Yeah, no, that was. 2696300-2697140
That was my plan afterwards, like, after this, I'm gonna start my first shift. 2697140-2700140
Oh, gosh. 2701420-2702380
Okay. 2702460-2703020
