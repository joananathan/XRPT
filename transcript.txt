Somehow have unrestricted access to all of the great pyramids of Egypt. 320-5200
Whoa. 5680-6160
No. 6240-6560
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen. 6560-8000
We'll be going into the tombs of ancient pharaohs. 8000-11000
Passageway we're in leads to what Egyptologists say is King Khufu's tomb. 11000-15280
The pharaoh who may have ordered the pyramids to be built. 15280-17840
Whoa. 18160-18720
Hey. 19280-19760
This room is called the Grand Gallery. 20560-23640
What percentage of this pyramid do you think we've seen so far? 23640-26160
We might never know the answer to that question. 26160-28160
That's the coolest way he could have answered that. 28900-30340
This next room, the highest point in the largest ancient pyramid on Earth. 30340-34660
Woo. 34660-35140
That was awesome. 35460-36660
Before we go explore the other giant pyramids, I wanna show you guys base camp. 37140-40740
Yeah, this is nice. 40980-41940
We got a dinner table, some tents to sleep in, and yo. 41940-47220
Wow. 47780-48260
Okay. 48340-48980
We even brought lights so you could see the pyramids from camp. 48980-52180
That's gotta be the most expensive nightlight that's ever existed. 52180-54660
This is the pyramid we're gonna explore tomorrow. 55220-57180
I wanna start at 5am Everyone get some. 57180-59540
These pyramids were so technologically advanced for their time that some credit them to a pre Egyptian civilization, while some point to even crazier theories, like aliens. 60880-70000
But Egyptologists are sure that they were built by the first Egyptians as tombs for their kings. 70000-74920
And by the end of this video, we're going to find out which of these theories is true. 74920-78320
All right, boys, I hope you're ready to explore the next pyramid on our list. 78400-82000
The pyramid of Khafre. 82000-83560
What is special about this monstrosity? 83560-86080
Well, this pyramid is how we learn how the casings of each pyramid look like. 86160-89880
This is how they all look like at some point. 89880-91880
That was right after the aliens built them. 91880-93620
No aliens. 93620-94460
Rami led us nearly 100ft below the Earth's surface, deep into Khafre's pyramid. 95020-100060
This is a place where hardly anyone in the modern world has ever been. 100060-103820
So to be honest, we had no idea what to expect going down here. 103980-107900
The ancient Egyptians had cardboard. 109180-111100
We believed that this was the burial chamber for King Khafre for the longest time. 111820-115980
And now they're using it to store stuff. 116220-118140
Well, they're restoring the pyramid, Jimmy. 118800-120640
They gotta use tools. 120640-121600
So that means there's a real burial chamber. 121600-123600
Yes. 123600-124040
Rami actually took us to the real resting place thought to have once held the body of King Khafre. 124040-129360
I see a big ceiling. 129360-130480
Whoa. 130480-130980
