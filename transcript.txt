Let's build an airship. 160-1800
So this is the beginning of the platform that I want the player to be standing on. 1800-5680
I really hope that this works. 5840-7440
I can already tell that it won't. 7600-8920
It should. 8920-9520
It doesn't even fly upwards. 9760-11000
Okay, let's start again. 11000-11920
I honestly think at this point I might be making a happy gasp with extra steps, but I don't care because I personally think this looks really, really interesting. 11920-20000
Ignore all of this, Obsidian. 20000-21280
Oh, but actually, while I'm down here, I don't know how I've never thought of this. 21280-24560
Armor stands for decoration inside of flying machines. 24720-28730
They're entities. 28730-29450
They don't contribute to the block push limit, but they can make really cool details to the build. 29450-34570
These almost look structural. 34570-35890
They look like part of the mechanism. 35890-37690
And I think without it, it would actually look really strange. 37690-39810
I've added more, and after a good few hours of playing around and testing various different arrangements, I think this is good to go. 39810-46610
Oh, but now that I've got the ghasts in, I forget they fly downwards a lot. 46610-51130
Like this looks. 51850-53460
This doesn't look like it's being pulled up by them at all. 53460-55580
If anything, it looks like it's being pulled down by them. 55580-57700
I've tried a variety of everything. 57700-59380
I even stacked a bunch of minecarts up. 59460-61420
So it's time for the most ridiculous, most stupid idea I've ever had. 61420-65220
Sometimes very good things come out of bad situations. 65300-68420
Who needs happy ghasts when you have levitating polar bears? 68740-73060
It actually looks pretty good. 75780-77140
It actually looks pretty good. 78020-79100
It doesn't look very chaotic. 79100-80300
They look. 80300-80740
They look inflatable. 81680-82840
They look very buoyant. 82840-84160
And as you can see, the system works. 84160-88160
So here we go. 92240-93200
There is our airship heading off into the sky. 93920-97920
This is so stupid. 98800-100080
This is. 100960-101400
This is. 101400-101840
It's not lost on me how ridiculously stupid this is. 101840-104280
Right? 104280-104520
I haven't actually tried out this. 104520-105720
This part, but no, we've. 105720-107450
We've managed to get by completely unscathed. 107450-110010
Everything has worked properly. 110010-111610
I gotta be honest, I was expecting so much more death. 111610-113570
So that's good. 113570-114210
It's made it up to the top station. 114210-116410
Now let's see if we can send it back down to the ground. 116730-119690
Nice. 122170-122650
There we go. 123690-124490
Our airship is descending. 125210-127050
Oh, no, we lost some. 127210-129610
Oh. 130650-131130
Oh, that's. 131530-132330
Oh, that's. 132650-133530
Ah, there's something deeply upsetting about that. 134280-137800
But regardless of those guys entering the Polar Bear space program, most of the others have made it down to the bottom safely, and this thing has returned back to its bottom station. 138360-152440
This is. 152600-153480
This is fantastic, isn't it? 153640-154800
But alas, of course, it's not possible. 154800-156880
In surviving Minecraft, there's no levitation potions. 156880-159280
I had to do a little bit of trickery to get this situation to occur. 159280-162640
This leads me to making a small suggestion to the Mojang devs, which is, when a happy ghast is tethered to something, it'd be really nice if it tried to travel upwards. 162640-171940
I think for builders and for animated Minecraft structures, it'll be nice to have something that reliably wants to go up. 172020-178820
That way we can make things like animated balloons, long vertical daisy chains and all sorts of bits and bobs. 178900-184140
