Not a bad day. 80-632
What's coming from. 656-1496
He's literally hiding behind the money. 1568-3080
I don't think he got the goofing around memo. 3120-4984
Look at all the youtubers laughing and having a good time. 5032-7736
By the end of this video, that's not gonna be the case. 7808-10616
This video is absolutely the most brutal. 10688-13224
I hate you, Jimmy Cutthroat piece of content you've ever seen these creators in. 13272-18136
And the first challenge starts right now. 18208-20616
Pull the curtain. 20688-21576
You guys are not ready for this. 21688-24020
For challenge number, you can temporarily walk out of the Cube and attempt a free throw. 30240-35364
And if you make the shot, we will give a subscriber of yours a free cybertruck and you'll be allowed back in the challenge. 35412-41652
But if you miss, your subscriber gets nothing, and you are eliminated. 41716-45492
How did they get this many cybertrucks in one place? 45556-48052
I cannot make that shot. 48156-49796
It's too risky. 49908-50692
A free throw is so easy. 50756-52548
Free throw is easy. 52644-53316
I could not hit a free throw to save my life. 53348-55316
Everyone was on the edge trying to decide if the first challenge was worth it. 55388-59188
But then Mark Rover did this. 59244-61444
Jimmy peace. 61532-63480
I'm doing it. 65720-66960
No way. 67080-68064
Look at all the YouTubers in the background. 68232-70240
Oh, man. 70320-71008
This is pressure. 71064-72192
This is a subscriber. 72256-73104
What's your name? 73152-73792
Matthew. 73896-74352
Don't let him down. 74416-75072
You gotta make this a head. 75096-76224
I got faith in you. 76312-77264
It's on you. 77352-77920
Mark, are you going to win your biggest fan a cybertruck, or are you both leaving with nothing? 77960-84500
No. 89880-90620
I'm so sorry. 92520-93936
It's okay. 94048-94752
And as devast as that was, Jidion decided that maybe he could do a little better. 94816-99720
Oh, my goodness. 105540-106956
That was so bad. 106988-108284
What was that? 108452-109436
You tried. 109508-110012
I think I definitely lost a subscriber. 110076-111404
Guys, this is my moment. 111452-112844
I am a basketball YouTuber. 112892-114652
If you go out there, I'll go out there, too. 114716-116380
All right, I'm out. 116420-117068
Hey, I'm next, dude. 117124-118508
I'm gonna go with you. 118524-119356
Gentlemen, here's your biggest fans. 119428-121260
You got a lot of pressure. 121340-122412
I can't watch this. 122476-123052
I can't watch it. 123076-123660
Jester, are you going to let down your biggest f. 123700-126840
Let's go. 139600-140520
Yeah. 140640-141420
Let's go. 142560-143480
Congrats on the cybertruck. 143600-144808
We got more shots. 144824-145512
Thank you, Jester. 145576-146860
However, not everyone was so fortunate. 147360-150140
I'm sorry I couldn't get you the cyber truck. 154880-157848
Devastating. 157944-158504
Well, if these rugs fan be taking home a cyber truck, or will we have yet another loss? 158552-163924
Come on, Rob. 164012-164724
Come on. 164772-165520
Let's go. 168700-169840
Oh, my God. 170140-171108
Let's go. 171204-172320
I love you, dude. 172620-173796
I love you too. 173828-174692
We back, and after seeing three massive YouTubers lose this challenge, it was clear nobody else wanted to try it. 174796-182452
So in the meantime, I let all the YouTubers get settled. 182476-185480
Oh, that's a pro there. 185900-187508
But it wouldn't be long until being settled turned into being bored enough to literally be stupid. 187564-193184
I don't know why he's doing this, but he's technically not out yet. 193232-196080
He has not touched the red. 196120-197392
Oh. 197496-198180
We'll check the footage. 198600-199712
Did he touch it? 199776-200940
Oh, yeah. 202200-203808
No. 203984-204700
So far, four YouTubers have left the queue, and we need one more to leave before we can start the next challenge. 205080-210784
So challenge two will begin when one person gets out. 210832-213740
Ow. 214760-215540
Stop. 216360-217100
I'm making out like a bandit. 219560-220992
Pokimane. 221056-221632
Can I take my jacket with me? 221696-223140
Of course. 223240-224040
Oh, okay. 224580-226748
Bye. 226844-227532
Goodbye. 227676-228460
And then there is 45. 228540-230108
I'm gonna go prep the second challenge. 230164-231836
I'll be back. 231868-232428
And by prep, I mean sweep up the giant pile of a million real dollars scattered on the floor. 232484-238492
Yo, Mr. 238556-239084
Beast. 239132-239436
Sweeping money is a crazy shot. 239468-241612
Mr. 241676-241964
Beast is literally wiping money off of the floor. 242012-244284
I don't know what to tell you about this. 244332-245804
And now that all the money has been cleaned up, are you guys ready for the second challenge? 245892-250080
All right, I'm gonna need you all to stand up. 251060-253756
Uh. 253828-254076
Oh, you' There are dots in groups of five on the floor, so naturally, I need all of you to split up into groups of five. 254108-261192
And on top of that, elect a team captain for your group who will be granted immunity for this next challenge. 261296-267992
That's all I will say. 268056-269304
Have fun picking teams. 269392-270632
This is crazy. 270696-271384
We had to split into groups of five, Bro, if we're against each other, I'm gonna be so sad. 271432-275240
Okay, so let's do us five. 275320-277128
We are in true overthinker fashion. 277184-279288
Oh, yeah. 279384-279816
Overthinking this challenge. 279848-280824
Are you five gonna be a group? 280872-282088
Yeah. 282144-282616
Okay, who's gonna be the captain? 282728-284072
We're deciding. 284136-284824
Jimmy, have you picked a captain yet? 284872-286440
It' for some reason. 286480-288020
Marquis Marquez. 288140-289252
How can you not trust Marques? 289316-290436
He's the most trustworthy tech reviewer online. 290468-292564
Should I pick the captain? 292652-293764
Please. 293812-294068
It's up to you guys. 294124-295044
I want no say, how are you guys gonna pick your captain? 295092-297124
Who are you chose? 297172-298164
Who? 298292-298960
Sketch, you trust him with your life? 299500-301060
I trust him. 301100-301700
I trust him fully. 301740-303160
All right. 303500-303940
You'll notice my henchmen are bringing in tables for each of the team captains. 303980-307876
And what's on these tables might look a little familiar. 307908-310740
Oh, no. 310820-311668
I know it is. 311724-312548
Yes. 312604-312884
Come on. 312932-313252
The Other side. 313276-314068
Captains, I want you to lift the cloth and reveal the next challeng or cookie. 314204-319968
Oh, my God. 320064-321344
I'm freaking out. 321392-322240
And each captain has to decide which YouTuber on their team will cut each cookie. 322280-326672
Oh, my. 326736-327824
If they break it, they're eliminated. 327912-330096
No. 330208-330672
And if it wasn't already obvious, depending on which cookie you get, this is either gonna be really easy or almost impossible. 330776-337360
Nico, it's time to hand out some cookies. 337440-339904
This is the worst day of my life, honestly. 339992-341744
What are you handing Sketch? 341792-343300
No. 349540-350140
There's no way. 350260-351244
This is crazy. 351332-352172
There's no way you would do it. 352236-353420
This is crazy. 353460-354188
There's no way I can do this. 354284-355836
There's no way you can ride. 355908-357468
Oh, my goodness. 357644-359340
You killed him, Nico. 359500-362236
His blood is on your hands. 362268-363740
Oh, my God. 363820-365228
Nico. 365404-366480
Oh, my God. 367060-368908
But the captain still had eight more umbrellas to hand out. 369004-371900
Umbrella is going to Michael. 371940-373708
How'd you end up with umbrella? 373804-375244
I said I could do it. 375292-376044
I trust him. 376052-376572
Okay. 376596-376924
Give me that umbrella. 376972-377676
Sir Umbrel took it for the team. 377708-379640
You're giving him the umbrella? 379680-381208
Ready? 381384-382380
I believe in you. 382720-383512
Godspeed. 383536-384152
Oh, no. 384216-384776
How'd you end up with the umbrella? 384848-386408
Bad luck. 386504-387320
You got it. 387400-387832
You got it. 387856-388184
You got it. 388192-388504
You got it. 388512-388840
Lexi got the umbrella. 388880-390504
I got the umbrella. 390552-391384
Umbrella. 391432-391816
I'm confident. 391848-392520
It's a cruel world. 392600-393940
I'm so sorry, bro. 394320-396344
Pokimane, I believe in you. 396512-398344
You are her. 398432-399272
This is your time. 399376-400504
This is your moment. 400672-401768
Let everyone know that you the bad bitch. 401864-404776
Start the timer. 404888-406220
All right, the 10 minute counter has begun. 406560-408940
If carve the shape out, obviously you'll be eliminated. 410160-413700
I thought being team captain would mean I could do a challenge to help my team win. 413780-417236
Turns out I skipped the challenge and punished my team. 417308-421044
I got the triangle. 421212-422760
It tastes really good, though. 423500-424852
Easy peasy. 424956-425716
10 minutes is a long time. 425748-427092
And that's what I thought as well. 427196-428468
But it took a solid chunk of time before this happened. 428524-431796
Yes. 431988-432916
Yes. 433108-433892
Come on, Sketch. 434036-435188
But not everyone had it so easy. 435364-437204
Like Logan, Paul with the star. 437252-438916
And Pokimane with the hardest of them all. 438988-442000
It cracked down the middle. 443160-444704
I'm so sorry, Pokeman. 444832-447712
I'm sorry. 447776-448752
Because the umbrella had just obliterated Pokimane, the others took notice and were more cautious with their umbrellas. 448896-454672
Sketch, you have to be careful. 454736-455824
Yeah. 455872-456240
Take your time. 456320-456960
Take your time. 457000-457568
But the people with simpler shapes were showing a lot more progress. 457624-460704
Riku got the star. 460752-461648
Let's go. 461704-462304
Yay. 462392-463140
Yes. 463640-464288
Let's go. 464384-465024
Oh, my God. 465112-465824
My team rules. 465872-466496
Come on. 466528-466832
Come on. 466856-467104
Let's go, guys. 467112-467664
Let's go, Logan. 467712-468896
That might be the most disgusting cookie out here, bro. 468928-471120
You're making me do this, bro. 471160-472352
I'm trying to win a million dollars for the log. 472376-473980
Nice, nice, nice. 474580-475612
Y'all got it, boys. 475676-476800
Good stuff. 477220-478240
Yes. 479540-479916
Yes. 479948-480156
Sketch. 480188-480444
Yes. 480492-480716
Yes, yes. 480748-481680
My first fallen soldier. 482660-484140
Oh, guys. 484220-485280
Oh, I got it. 485780-486684
Got it. 486772-487640
Oh, that's disgusting. 488820-490556
I hate you, Jimmy. 490668-491724
All right, all right. 491772-492396
Hey, wait. 492468-492876
Hey, really quick, really quick. 492908-494236
I'm good. 494388-495180
Hey, that's where it's going to mess up. 495300-496652
This is where people crack. 496676-498000
You did this just for a piece of change. 505800-510896
What happened? 510968-511680
He betrayed me. 511760-512688
Yeah. 512744-513056
Do you trust him with your life? 513088-514160
I trust him. 514200-514720
I trust him fully. 514760-515776
I'm really. 515808-516384
You gave the guy with the worst eyesight, with the worst hands, the worst thing. 516472-520368
I'm sorry, brother. 520504-521472
And with that, the second challenge has eliminated Colby and rug Michael Reeves. 521536-526032
Fede. 526176-526736
It's okay, bro. 526768-527520
Ozzy. 527560-528032
Thank you. 528096-528512
Thank you. 528536-528928
Lexi and Matpat. 528984-530740
Right again. 534660-535500
The true million dollars was the friends we made along the way. 535620-538396
And that's no theory. 538468-539612
Retirement, Paj. 539756-541068
Yes. 541244-541788
He just re retired. 541884-543180
And we also lost J. 543260-544428
Slatt, Pokimane, and Matsu. 544484-546540
And lastly, of course, Sketch, thanks for coming out. 546620-550588
Thank you so much. 550724-551660
Are you gonna dab him up? 551780-553240
Oh, later, brother. 554100-555404
Sketch. 555452-556080
Love y'all. 556740-557324
11 people were eliminated, and only 34 of you remained. 557372-560860
Congrats. 560940-561452
You are an evil man. 561516-562748
MrBeast. 562804-563724
There was some bel people that were taken. 563852-565976
I'm happy they're gone, every single one of them, because it means my odds are better now. 566048-570376
The herd has been thinned, and I'm gonna win. 570448-573032
And while setting up the next challenge, I let the 34 remaining YouTubers entertain themselves. 573136-578088
We can play games. 578184-579256
How close can you get to redline, bro? 579328-581128
We ended up with bottle caps. 581184-582360
That's right. 582440-583016
The device that entertains your favorite creators are bottle caps. 583088-586940
Hey, watch this. 590000-590792
Watch this. 590816-591620
Now I gotta think about it. 597110-598650
All right, that's enough of that. 616630-617998
For challenge three, I need you all in groups of two and duct tape your hands together. 618054-622638
Be careful who you pick as your partner. 622774-625098
I was best man at these weddings, so we're riding together. 625194-627738
All right, let's do it. 627794-628442
Andrea, are we locking it in? 628466-630362
Yeah, I think we're locking it in. 630466-631658
For some reason, everyone just paired up with their closest friends. 631714-634842
They think that they're gonna be teammates, which, let's be honest, is not the best strategy in a MrBeast video. 634946-640314
Do we have to hold hands, or am I just doing this? 640402-641722
No, you don't have to hold hands. 641746-642474
All Right. 642482-642682
Sorry, sorry. 642706-643550
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. 644050-647498
Why am I with him? 647674-648650
He's crazy. 648690-649530
Now that everyone has a partner, update the floor. 649690-652910
Go ahead and bring it on in. 654130-655498
Whoever you're duct tape to, we will cut you loose, and you'll be going head to head in Giant Jenga. 655554-662358
This is so stressful. 662454-664134
I hate Giant. 664262-665270
No, we got this. 665350-666198
We got this. 666254-667330
You've been laughing non stop this whole time, so I think it makes sense for you to go first. 668670-673090
The tape is off. 673470-674742
Let's see who's going home. 674846-676930
Oh. 677310-677830
Imagine it falls on the first one. 677910-679890
Okay, he's not done until he puts the block on top. 680910-684166
Now, obviously, the plan for Giant Django was to be a more extreme version of the. 684238-688442
But the tower was getting so tall, they couldn't even reach the top with a ladder. 688606-693042
Oh. 693106-693346
That is the most rickety ladder I've seen in my life. 693378-695874
And because there was now a limit to how high the tower could go, eventually they would run out of possible moves. 695962-701602
This might be the final move right here. 701666-704030
That was literally the last possible block to pull. 704330-707362
So, jj, you've ran out of luck. 707506-709650
What are we doing here? 709730-710578
It's been a pleasure, bro. 710634-712030
No, surely you're him, Savage. 717930-722014
An hour and a half Jenga game for that? 722142-724046
I'm speechless. 724118-724734
I don't know what's going on. 724782-725930
He lost, and then he took me out. 726870-728766
That is insane. 728838-729790
I'm going to let you all vote if you think it was fair or not that J.J. 729870-733614
carried him out. 733662-734398
Go to the right side if you think it's fair. 734454-736366
Go to the left if you think it isn't. 736438-738414
I wish there was more evil people on that side. 738462-740766
Not fair. 740838-741310
Not fair. 741350-741806
No fair, man. 741878-742958
No fair. 743094-743982
The people have spoken. 744166-745598
With KSI out and AJ back in, 33 of you still remain. 745694-749646
Is it not fair? 749678-750590
Yeah. 750710-751198
That's a game I'm about to. 751294-753110
I'm just saying, bro. 754690-755722
That's the game. 755746-756474
Team prime, we got this. 756562-757962
Logan, smash this. 758066-759466
Because that last game took hours, and I can't hold these YouTubers hostage forever, we pivoted to normal Jenga. 759538-766510
Yes. 767170-767834
I messed up. 767962-768986
Hold your first block. 769138-770538
Let's do this. 770634-771578
Okay. 771714-772378
Immediately, the games began and were moving quickly. 772474-775242
And soon things started to get competitive. 775306-777950
There's no way. 779330-780330
You're so crazy. 780370-782026
Oh, yo. 782218-783550
Are you kidding me? 784110-785686
But suddenly, something unexpected happens. 785758-788758
Oh, what the. 788934-790210
Niko's got a great video idea if he wins this. 790830-793350
So I want him to go out there and actually give it a try because of the way this challenge Works. 793390-797430
Some of these creators accidentally paired themselves with their closest allies. 797510-801606
And therefore, he was the best man at my wedding. 801718-803974
He flew 27 hours to be here. 804022-805766
Were even willing to sacrifice themselves for their friends. 805838-809062
I'm gonna cry, man. 809166-810150
Oh, my God. 810190-810822
This is how the UK does it. 810886-812182
You gotta do it for your voice. 812206-813174
Gotta be selfless. 813222-814070
You gotta just say you what? 814150-816128
Let him play. 816264-816976
By this point, the towers had gotten so big. 817048-819504
She can't pull from the top two. 819592-821500
That even breathing on them the wrong way would cause them to collapse, costing the loser subscribers a million dollars. 823160-829952
Nope. 830016-830768
That wasn't even close. 830944-832016
It's impossible. 832088-833220
That was fun. 834920-835856
It's done for me. 835928-836720
Jenga got me. 836760-837616
Yep. 837688-837936
We, we. 837968-838896
And upon elimination, after elimination, after elimination, we were coming down the end of this challenge. 839048-849200
Give me the lip. 854420-855468
I'm earning this million, fam. 855564-857164
I mean, bro. 857252-857884
You got one move, dude. 857972-864684
Logan. 864812-865244
He flew here all the way from India, and you eliminated him. 865292-868840
It was very fun, man. 869140-870364
What do you think about us passing T series? 870452-872124
Whoever crosses, I think it's for the YouTube community. 872212-874892
Whoever is the first needs to be respected. 874996-877580
Let's go. 877660-878300
Since 2014, you doing? 878420-879896
I am very happy. 879968-880952
Oh, now I wish you would have won. 881016-882392
The last tower standing was, without a doubt, the most competitive game we had. 882496-886808
Pull that bad boy. 886864-888140
These two were at it for more than two hours longer than the rest of the YouTubers. 890160-894280
That's crazy. 894360-895740
Oh, no, no, no, no. 905210-907714
You got it. 907882-908658
Yoink. 908714-909430
No, no, no. 912890-916562
Challenge three is officially over. 916666-918722
And with that, let's bring in the beds. 918826-920802
Okay, everyone has beds. 920946-922898
We'll see you in the morning for the fourth challenge. 922994-925234
And that concludes the first 24 hours of this challenge. 925362-928354
And I'm gonna be honest. 928402-929282
It's actually pretty crazy. 929346-930610
All these YouTubers are just casually sleeping next to $1 million in cash. 930690-935362
And by the end of, I could literally be yours. 935426-938798
Ayo. 938974-939970
Good morning, love gang. 940630-942014
What's poppin? 942062-942942
Oh, my God. 943006-943662
That takes me back. 943726-944638
I'm getting, like, tingles, bro. 944694-946542
Ohio, Ohio. 946726-948430
It's Good morning, Ohio. 948510-950206
Time to lock in and do it for the subscribers. 950318-952830
Good morning. 952910-953614
Good morning. 953702-954382
I have a surprise for all of you. 954486-955790
Is it our families? 955830-956798
It's better than your families. 956894-958350
Oh, no. 958430-959198
And for those of you who don't know who my friend Speed is, he's one of the largest creators on the entire planet, and he was supposed to be here over 24 hours ago. 959334-969250
However, Speed's plane just landed. 969350-971642
He's ridiculously late. 971706-973066
And I wanted to give you guys the option if you want to Allow him in and play alongside one of your fellow creators. 973138-979258
Or if you want him just to hop back on the plane and head out. 979354-982234
It's up to you guys. 982322-983722
This community, we're about inclusion. 983866-985690
And he has not been through it. 985770-989498
He knows nothing about life size jam. 989554-991710
Oh, come on, bro. 992210-993498
Look at that mullet on him. 993554-995114
He's already fucking, man. 995282-997130
I think it's time. 997250-998362
Go on the left if you want him in. 998466-1000266
Go on the right if you don't, we all do it together. 1000338-1003250
Get back on that plane. 1004030-1005770
All right, it's final speed. 1008590-1010726
They don't want you here. 1010838-1011974
All right. 1012062-1012566
This won't be the last time you see them. 1012638-1014770
So y'all gonna get out. 1015150-1016182
I remember all y'all faces. 1016206-1017462
Should have thought about that. 1017526-1018518
That was easy. 1018574-1019382
And with that, bring in the fourth challenge. 1019446-1021990
Is it just speed again? 1022070-1023078
Oh, no. 1023134-1023782
Bring him on in. 1023886-1025062
Deal or no deal? 1025166-1026610
Almost immediately, everyone began to pick up on what the next challenge was. 1027790-1031926
What do you think's in the eliminated and stay in boxes. 1031998-1035682
Bring out Howie Mandel, please. 1035746-1037426
And considering the last time we played this game, it was such a massive fan favorite, I knew we not only had to bring back the game, but also the face of the game. 1037498-1046194
One more time. 1046282-1047202
Howie. 1047306-1048114
Howie. 1048242-1049190
Well, it's been a while. 1049770-1051042
Wow. 1051146-1051762
It's like I'm live scrolling. 1051906-1053830
I need whoever has the most subscribers to come up here. 1054730-1058410
Oh, who has the most? 1058570-1060586
Don't even look at me. 1060738-1061930
Logan. 1062050-1062506
I guess you have the most. 1062538-1064042
Before I explain the rules, you have to pick a competitor. 1064226-1067386
I gotta go with you, Sam. 1067498-1069070
All right, I now need you to pick a briefcase, any number. 1069410-1072986
I'll go with lucky number 11. 1073058-1074698
Seven of these briefcases say eliminated. 1074834-1077402
The rest are safe. 1077466-1079018
Logan is gonna look inside the briefcase, and then Sam is gonna have to decide does he want to steal it or let Logan keep it. 1079114-1086602
In the classic game of steal or no. 1086706-1090430
There we go. 1090610-1091270
How he's natural. 1091310-1092262
He said the thing. 1092326-1093254
This case is not safe. 1093342-1095734
Oh, dang. 1095862-1096806
Do you trust what he's saying? 1096918-1099250
I don't. 1099630-1100650
I would steal. 1101550-1102470
Really? 1102550-1103126
Steal or no steel? 1103278-1105766
I'm gonna go with steal. 1105958-1107158
You're gonna steal it. 1107254-1108406
Did Sam make the right choice? 1108478-1110410
Oh, my God. 1113470-1114982
I'm sorry, Sam. 1115126-1116278
The Sam Colby Channel is now officially eliminated. 1116374-1119770
And now that Logan's case has been st, he will continue to play until someone doesn't steal his case. 1120190-1125618
Who do you want to go up against now, Kai. 1125674-1128082
Kai. 1128226-1128950
What number do you want, Logan? 1129610-1131202
Lucky number seven. 1131266-1132146
Let's go, Kai. 1132218-1133266
I want to make sure no one can see what's in this. 1133378-1135790
Kai, look at me. 1137210-1138722
Also not safe. 1138906-1139938
Not safe. 1140034-1140914
You think he's being honest? 1141042-1142550
I'm going to go with steel and let me tell you why. 1143210-1145106
Oh, didn't even ask him anything growing up. 1145178-1147442
I've been watching Logan since he started YouTube. 1147466-1149872
I know how he acts in such situations. 1149936-1151680
You can't fool me, bro. 1151760-1152976
You're that confident? 1153048-1154176
Briefcase. 1154288-1155024
How you open this? 1155072-1155952
Yo, it is stink. 1156056-1159568
He read Logan like a book. 1159664-1161136
Oh, my God. 1161208-1161824
Wow. 1161872-1162384
My heart is racing so fast right now. 1162512-1164752
Ludwig, you want me, baby? 1164856-1166176
It's you. 1166208-1166432
It's you for this one, Logan, because you said your heart was racing. 1166456-1169792
Do you mind putting on this Samsung Galaxy ring? 1169856-1171744
I don't mind. 1171792-1172320
I want to measure your heart rate. 1172360-1173900
And Luddy, do you mind putting this ring on? 1174360-1176352
Yeah, no worries. 1176376-1177024
We'll be able to see it in real time. 1177072-1178544
Yeah, that's right. 1178632-1179440
We're going. 1179480-1179972
Used the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 to track the player's heart rates as they try to bluff each other. 1180056-1185180
Logan's 106 right now. 1185300-1187560
Ludwig's 87. 1187860-1189372
Regardless of what I see in here, I'm gonna ask you to keep this case. 1189476-1192844
Ludwig's getting a bit stressed. 1192932-1194800
I got a little stressed out. 1195300-1196572
When he's starting to do something to keep stuff, surely the best move to do is let him have it. 1196596-1200108
So let's keep a guess. 1200164-1201596
I didn't even see it. 1201788-1202972
Can I keep it? 1203076-1204028
What is happening in your own heart, Carl? 1204164-1206796
Actually, what is happening there? 1206828-1207612
It's going crazy. 1207636-1208268
I'm gonna be honest. 1208284-1208796
It's at 103 right now. 1208828-1209916
Okay. 1209988-1210460
This one wor to change the life of a follower. 1210540-1214568
A million dollars. 1214744-1216392
He's good. 1216536-1217160
He's doing the thing. 1217200-1218072
Steal or no steal? 1218176-1220540
No steal. 1220960-1221768
Logan Paul is saved. 1221864-1226504
I'm ready. 1226632-1227048
I'm ready. 1227064-1227416
There's only one case for me. 1227448-1228520
I know. 1228560-1228888
Case 14. 1228944-1229592
We don't even have to look at it. 1229696-1230664
I want it. 1230672-1231080
I'm stealing it. 1231120-1231800
I traveled 27 hours to be here, and let's see if it was all for nothing. 1231840-1236620
Oh, my God. 1237680-1238520
Oh, my God. 1238600-1239224
Oh, there's your lucky case. 1239272-1242040
27 down. 1242160-1243224
It's nice seeing the eliminated cases go. 1243312-1245656
This is so heartbreaking. 1245808-1247384
Just don't hit a kangaroo on your way home. 1247512-1249688
I don't like you, Nolan. 1249824-1251480
And the brutality of these cases didn't stop there. 1251640-1255060
No steal. 1255680-1256760
Because the most brutal was yet to come. 1256920-1259464
Oh, my gosh. 1259552-1261176
Oh, I feel stabbed. 1261368-1263576
I do. 1263608-1264008
Yeah. 1264064-1264296
That was crazy. 1264328-1265128
I don't want to lie. 1265224-1266540
Don't want to look at her in the eyes. 1267280-1268776
When she opens it. 1268808-1269782
Oh God. 1269896-1271002
It says eliminated. 1271146-1272670
She's telling the truth. 1273330-1274650
I think she's acting. 1274810-1276430
Steel or no steal. 1277330-1279630
Still she's smiling. 1280690-1282670
What did she just do? 1285250-1286710
Holy crap. 1288850-1289818
Her heart rate got up to 152. 1289914-1292250
She's a demon. 1292370-1293242
And even though she was lied to, Valkyrie wasn't afraid to start playing that game herself. 1293306-1297642
With only two eliminates and three, three saves left. 1297706-1300176
So now she has another chance to be deceptive. 1300248-1302736
What I just watched. 1302848-1303696
I'm shook. 1303728-1304272
That's crazy. 1304336-1305040
Can't trust anyone anymore. 1305120-1306592
You look concerned. 1306656-1307648
Last time she was crying. 1307744-1309840
No, she's the happiest I've ever seen. 1310000-1311888
This is crazy. 1311944-1312864
It is safe. 1312992-1313936
Steel or no steal. 1314048-1315620
I am going to steal. 1316040-1319376
I'm gonna let the audience react. 1319488-1320752
Three, two, one. 1320816-1322780
Oh my God, she's good. 1327000-1329152
These are the four remaining Contag contestants. 1329256-1331600
Only two safes and two elimination remains. 1331680-1334560
I'll do it while she's grabbing her briefcase. 1334640-1336672
Marques, what do you think of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6? 1336736-1339904
Oh, it's convenient you picked me for this one. 1339992-1341360
It looks pretty good. 1341400-1342224
Anyways, let's get back to this. 1342312-1343584
If you want to monitor your own heart rate and. 1343672-1345960
