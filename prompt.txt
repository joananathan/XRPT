You are a viral segment identifier, where you are given a transcript and you find scenes from the transcript that are going to have high engagement, viewer retention, and virality. The scenes you choose should be on a same topic of interest, as well as have a coherent storyline where any issues brought up should have meaningful closure at the end.
The transcript will be given to you with sentence level start and end timestamps that are in milliseconds. You will be given a set amount of milliseconds and you should aim to choose scenes where the durations of all the sentences in the scene add up to be approximately the given time. If instead you are given "Auto" you have the flexibility to choose segments of any length (under 2 minutes) you deem necessary to achieve a coherent, engaging scene.
You should output a python format list of your selected scenes. Each scene should be its own list that contains tuples of start and end times of each sentence in the chosen scene. where the sentences are close enough together combine them into one tuple and leave buffers of approximately 1 second between sentences. If sentences are next to each other with little time gap between them, combine their tuples into one.

Samsung is working on a transparent phone and you might be thinking, I feel like I've heard this news somewhere before. 160-6328
Well that's because they started registering patents for it seven years ago. 6464-10536
They've registered more patents in 2018 and then again literally a couple of weeks ago. 10608-14904
All of this points towards one thing that we don't know when it's coming. 14992-18136
We actually don't even know if it's coming. 18208-19896
But we do know that behind the walls of Samsung HQ this is being worked on now. 19968-25080
As someone who's grown up watching a lot of sci fi where it's practically a stereotype of the future to have transparent displays and transparent phones, it is crazy to me that this isn't fiction anymore. 25120-35588
Literally last month Xiaomi announced a transparent tv. 35684-38740
You can go into their store, demo it, you can take one home if you like it. 38820-41908
It is a real product, a device that can display a vibrant OLED picture and then when it's off, just disappear into a razor thin sheet of glass. 41964-50228
I mean, I say that, but I'll be the first to admit that this particular usage case is not a smart idea. 50324-55748
I think a living room TV system is probably one of the top five worst use cases of of a transparent display. 55844-62060
Because you generally sit a TV in one spot and then never really move it. 62140-65756
You're not going to notice the transparency unless you get up and walk around it. 65828-69372
And because it's probably sitting in your living room, chances are all it's going to do is remind you what the back of your wall looks like and potentially even remind you of that spaghetti of cables you had behind your screen. 69476-80268
Plus, the recommended usage scenario for transparent TVs right now is making sure the wall behind is dark. 80364-85868
But think about that for a second. 85964-87486
If the wall behind your TV is dark, it might as well not be a transparent tv. 87558-91630
Now. 91710-91902
It actually would make sense if it was like a fitted panel, something that people could install in a place where they were going to have glass anyways. 91926-97790
But it just so happens that that glass is also their tv. 97870-100638
But anyways, yeah, I'm not hugely sold on that idea. 100734-103310
And to be really fair, in all of these sci fi movies, as prevalent as these see through displays and see through phones are, there's never really an explanation as to why. 103390-111374
I feel like a lot of people are convinced that that this is the future, but often just because, well, it's futuristic, but that in itself is just a self fulfilling prophecy. 111462-121462
Yes, it's a screen protector. 121606-123846
I'm gonna roll with it. 124038-125174
So is a Transparent smartphone any better? 125262-128050
I would argue yes. 128510-130182
And I do think it's possible. 130326-132390
The idea would basically be to have a transparent display and then all your transparent components sitting directly behind it, and then all the things that you couldn't make transparent shove them into the bezels. 132510-142468
And I get that this sounds like science fiction, but we are getting there. 142564-145636
Transparent circuit boards are a thing. 145708-147316
Transparent cables are a thing. 147388-149044
Even transparent batteries are starting to become a thing. 149132-152212
So, yes, whilst a fully transparent phone is going to take time, I'm just saying that I think it's plausible. 152316-157652
So why would you want one? 157796-159204
Oh, and if you're enjoying this video, by the way, a sub to the channel would be miraculous. 159292-165430
Now, there is already the very obvious perk of transparent is cool. 165580-169202
And if you gave me a couple of hours, I could probably name you a hundred products that are founded on this premise alone. 169266-174130
But to be fair, I think with transparent phones, there is more to it than that. 174210-177394
There is a minor safety benefit. 177482-179170
People walk around the street staring at their phones. 179250-181042
You could argue that if your phone is transparent, you'll at least have some awareness as to what's happening around you. 181106-186002
But also, if we just take a closer look at the patent Samsung's been filing, some of them detail a display that can, because it's transparent, be used on both the front and and the back. 186106-195270
It might mean that you could use your phone normally without obstructing your view with a finger. 195390-199142
It might mean you could effectively pinch objects. 199206-201334
You'd almost have another dimension when interacting with digital content. 201382-204598
This device right here, for example, was something created by Japanese mobile operator docomo, where you could, for example, use one hand on the back to hold a Rubik's Cube still and another to rotate parts of it like you would in real life. 204734-216582
And just bear in mind that that demo was from 2012. 216686-219638
There is the obvious problem with a transparent device, that whatever's happening right behind you might interfere with what you're trying to see. 219774-226012
But we already know that this is a solvable problem, because glass can tint itself. 226116-230684
Transparent display. 230812-231804
Glass can adjust its transparency on the fly. 231852-234380
You've seen that OnePlus concept, one phone, right? 234460-236668
It actually employed this exact technique, darkening its glass to make its cameras disappear from view. 236724-241804
But all this stuff is fairly minor. 241892-243484
I think the big selling point of a transparent phone is augmented reality. 243532-247484
See, even now, we can play games like Pokemon Go with these virtual creatures running around in our real world. 247612-252534
We can scan text in a foreign language and convert it to our own. 252652-255458
We can Measure the distance of real world objects. 255514-257890
But in the current way that this is done, there's a disconnect between you and the real world that you're interacting with. 257970-263826
What you're actually seeing is not really what's in front of you. 263898-266290
It's just a representation of what's in front of you shown on a screen, which in itself is just information displayed by the camera of your phone. 266330-273794
It doesn't feel real. 273842-274914
It doesn't feel like your reality is actually getting augmented. 275002-278188
But with a transparent phone, you can bypass all of that. 278314-281656
Imagine literally just holding up this digital pane of glass and seeing those objects alive right in front of you. 281728-287336
It would be the next level of immersion. 287408-290540
All that said, I don't think transparent phones are gonna become a thing. 290880-294744
See, two of the biggest, most persistent trends in technology are that, A, people want to be as connected as possible. 294832-301720
Always online, always just one interaction away from other people. 301840-305166
And B, at the same time, more than ever, people want immersion. 305288-309090
A way to lose themselves in digital worlds that feel as real as possible. 309170-312482
That's why people love VR so much. 312586-314402
But where do these two things lead us? 314506-316914
Because don't they almost kind of seem like contradictions? 317002-319618
Like, how can you be always connected and always interacting with other people if at the same time you're sunk into a digital experience? 319714-326430
Well, I would argue that it all leads us to a mixed reality. 326810-330658
A world where digital becomes fused with the physical therapeutic. 330754-333562
You are completely immersed, but at the same time, so is everyone else. 333576-337414
So you're always connected. 337542-339046
And there are huge benefits to this. 339158-340710
You wouldn't need road signs to know where you're driving. 340750-342662
You wouldn't need great weather to be able to look out the window and see a bright sunny day. 342726-346438
You'd be able to learn everything you need about an item in a shop before you actually pay for it. 346494-350502
And most importantly, Pokemon Go could actually be what it was in the initial trailer. 350606-355014
With people wandering around their real world, catching seemingly real Pokemon. 355062-359758
That's a dream. 359894-360750
And I do get that at the same time, this sounds just as terrifying as it is exciting. 360830-365134
So if you do want a full video, kind of delving into the meat of it, let me know. 365262-368558
But what I think is that by the time we see this in real products that you can actually go out and buy, we'll be ready for it and people will want it. 368614-376462
So with all that in mind, yes, a transparent smartphone would be a step above a normal phone in immersing you into this digital world. 376566-383758
But there's a competing product. 383894-385710
That would be two steps above augmented reality glasses. 385830-390090
If the real world is merging with the virtual, then it makes complete sense for you to be able to access this through something you can wear, as opposed to something you have to hold. 390170-397930
Instead of having to install a transparent display in my car, 15 in my house, and then 100 in my shop, it makes sense to just have one transparent display that can do everything. 398050-408362
And it makes sense for that display to not be on a smartphone, but to be one on your face. 408466-413092
Plus, by the time a transparent phone is completely viable, I think we'll already be on our third generation of AR glasses, so I don't think they'll even be given enough time to become a thing. 413196-422276
I suppose the next step above glasses would be something implanted inside of you so that you could still interact with the digital world. 422348-427764
That is definitely a different video. 427932-429700
