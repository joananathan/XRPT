transcript = """It's Mumbo and Grian time. 80-1280
Hungry Hermits has been on the hermitcraft server for months now, and I've been way too scared to play it. 1280-5560
I'm bad at games, I'm bad at organizing things, and I'm bad at communicating with people. 5560-9840
All things that are very important for Hungry Hermits. 9920-12880
But when I found out Grian hadn't played Hungry Hermits either, I realized there's a golden opportunity here. 12880-18000
So we're getting together. 18000-18720
We're going to play a couple of rounds. 18720-20000
The first few rounds are going to be on my channel. 20000-22400
Prepare yourselves. 23280-24080
And then the second set of rounds are going to be on Grian's channel. 24240-27240
And hopefully by then we'll. 27240-28540
We will have slightly improved. 28610-29770
Now, for anyone unfamiliar with Hungry Hermits, it's a game a little bit like overcooked. 29770-34210
You have a handful of tables. 34210-36290
The tables gradually fill up with customers who are demanding meals. 36290-40050
You then have to prepare those meals using things found within the restaurant. 40210-44370
And there's a number of time traps and obstacles and things that you have to do. 44449-49090
Essentially, this game is about organization, keeping a level head, and managing tasks effectively. 49090-54930
All things that me and Grian, and not exactly famous for. 54930-58750
So after our initial play test with Tango went incredibly well. 58750-62350
Oh, I've got. 62590-63270
We've got a customer. 63270-63990"""
